tines, who sought to abuse Christian liberty as an occasion to the
flesh, returns to the assumption contained in the fourteenth verse

‘ A husband has dominion over a woman, who is subject to a
husband, so long as he himself lives·

‘ Therefore the law has dominion over us only while we live
under the law.’
