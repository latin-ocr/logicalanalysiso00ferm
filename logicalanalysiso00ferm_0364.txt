322 LOGICAL ANALYsls OF THE

whereby the correction is amplified3 “exercise judgment’'-—-the
finite effect whereby he illustrates the injunction3 “ that'’—the
note of the end of the finite effect. “ Ye may not put a stumbling-
block, or cause of offence, in a brother’s way’'——is the proposition
of the injunction3 wherein the apostle makes use of two terms to
express that from which he prohibits the stronger in the Church :
the first of these, πρόσκομμα, denotes—-‘ that on which the feet of
those walking on a journey stumble, so that it is a hindrance to
their progress on their journey ς’ while ‘⁴ cause of offence,'' on the
other hand, has more a reference to the mind. The import, there—
fore, of the injunction which the apostle here gives to the stronger,
is this :—‘ that they should not put an obstacle or hindrance in
the way either of the inward or outward actions of their weaker
brethren, while they are advancing in the path of salvation?

would not do, or to omit what they otherwise would not omit3
each of which, the apostle pronounces evil, or a sin, as being done

without faith. The apostle is not content with simply propound- ,

—‘ that we must exer-eise judyment for this end, that we may not
put a stumbling-block in the way either of the mind or outward
actions of a weak brother3 and that that judgment of ours is to be
exercised in this, rather than in judging others, whether stronger
or weaken'

‘ the judgment' which he has said we are to exercise for this end,
that we may not give cause of offence to a weak brother3 and the
prolepsis consists of two parts. The first prolepsis is this z—the
“ stronger might say—‘ that they had been taught by the liberty of
the gospel, that nothing is impure in lawful use ; and, consequent-g
ly, that they ought to follow the doctrine of Christian liberty iu
eating all things, only using them religiously, and not to stop or
