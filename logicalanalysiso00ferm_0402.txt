makes the request, an opinion honourable in the Lord, concerning
those whose prayers he requests: for we will never entreat the
prayers of those of whom we have a mean opinion. By requesting
the Romans, therefore, to strive for him in prayers to God, the
apostle shews that he regards them as “ full of goodness,'’ of which
he has before professed his persuasion (v. 14.) “Through the
Lord «J esus Christ, and the love of the Spirit? These prayers
which he requests, he amplifies variously, by their causes, adjunct,
subject, and ends. The causes are two. The first is—our “ Lord
J esus Christ ;’' for a common participation in him as the one and
same Lord of all of us who believe, should give rise in all to mutual
prayers, and cause all and each of us to pray for one another through
him. The second cause is—-“ the love of the Spirit ;'' which is that
whereby the Holy Spirit dwells in the sanctified, and is twofold:
the one is—“ the love of God, shed forth in our hearts by the
'Spirit’' himself ; the other arises out of this, and is—‘ that with
- which we piously regard each other in J esus Christ, on account
of our common participation in the love of God, with which he
himself regards us all in common in Christ Jesus? Ι conceive that
’, both kinds of love are to be understood here 3 and that the apostle
,founds the prayers which he requests of the Romans, on the love
wherewith we are bound to regard each other in J esus Christ,
arising out of the love wherewith God himself regards us all
,in Christ J esus—both of which are wrought in us by the Holy
Spirit of God. The adjunct is indicated by the term-——‘ striving,’
‘when the apostle says—“ that ye strive for me in prayers to God.'’
‘ Striving,’ moreover, requires two things :—‘ continued struggling
2until the victory be known 3' and ‘ the zeal of perseverance ς’ he
therefore requests two things :—‘ that they should be earnest in
= praying and entreating ς’ and ‘ that they should persevere in that
· Jzeal, until at length they heard of his deliverance.’ Of these
