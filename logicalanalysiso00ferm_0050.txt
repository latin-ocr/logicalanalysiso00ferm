8 LOGICAL ANALYsis OF THE

thence to the l5th verse of Chap. XV„ is an exhortation to a life
worthy of the gospel.

The substance of the first part is a definit-ion of the gospel.
‘⁴ Tm: GOSPEL,’' says Paul, “ 1s THE Pownss OF Gon UNTo SALVA-
TION To EVERY ΘΝΕ THAT BELIEVETH ;⁷' a definition consisting of
three parts, viz., (l.) The genus—‘⁴ it is the power of God 3⁹² (2.)
The end for the speeific difference—“unto salvation;” (3.) The
subject—which is, ‘⁶ every one that believeth the gospel.'’

The gospel is said to be ‘⁶ the power of God” by a metonymy of

as the apostle speaks in the 20th‘ verse of this same chapter, “ from
the creation of the world,”* and “ by the things that He has
created,’' which also are the power of God, ‘⁴ the invisible things
of God being understood, are clearly seen.” The creation of the
world, therefore, is the power of God, whereby He himself becomes
known, just as by the gospel, but with this differenee, that from the ·
gospel He becomes known “ unto salvation,'‘ whereas, from crea-
tion, He becomes known, not to salvation, but to leave men “ with-
out excuse,'’ while God judges them 3 and this difference the aPostle
