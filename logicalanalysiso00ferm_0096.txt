54 LOGICAL ANALYSIS oF THE

worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly‚ that
is, he is justified by saith?

The argument is drawn from what equally follows in the ease of
opposites : for ‘ to work,’ or ί to acquire righteousness by works,’
and that ‘righteousness should be imputed from faith,' or ⁴ given
steely,' are opposites 3 and so are—‘ to be justified from debt,’ or
‘ to receive a reward,' and ‘ to believe on him that justifieth· the
ungodly.' The antecedent of the enthymeme is contained in this
verse, amplified by a contrast :—‘ To him that worketh, that is,

to whom righteousness is imputed from works, it is given, not by ’
grace, but from debt.'

5.ι “ But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that
justifieth the ungodly, his faith is imputed for righteousness.”
We have in these words the consequent of the enthymeme, also
amplified by the help of a contrast. It is to be observed that the
attribute or predicate here stands first, and that the subject is put
after it: for instead of saying, as he might have done—‘ he to

whom saith is imputed for righteousness worketh not, but believeth -

011 him that justifieth the ungodly,’ (the inference, to wit, being
drawn contrariwise), the apostle, having converted the statement,
expresses himself as if the inference were direct, in contradictories3
although, according to the mind and scope of the apost-le, the in-
ference should be contrariwise, from opposites‚ the order of the
terms only being altered, by transposition, instead of saying, (as
we have already remarked that he might have done) ‘ he to whom
saith is imputed for righteousness,' Sco. It should also be noticed
that the expressions—‘⁶ the reward is imputed from grace‚’' and
“ believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly,” or “ his faith is

imputed for righteousness,'’ are here synonymous3 as also ‘ that to
him that worketh the reward is imputed from works,' and that “ to

him that worketh the reward is imputed from debt : '' but that
‘ working,' and ‘ having one’s faith imputed for righteousness ς’
also ‘ imputing from grace,’ and ‘imputing stom debt.‚’ are oppo-
sites.
