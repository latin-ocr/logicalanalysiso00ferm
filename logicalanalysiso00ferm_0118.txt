where there is no sin. VVhfflefore, if all from Adam to Moses
were under death, all stom Adam to Moses were also under sin.
Here it is worthy of remark that the apostle does not simply say
that ζ there zoas death’ but that “death reiyned from Adam to
Moses 3⁹⁹ he thereby intimates that the prevalence of death in the
world attracted observation because all died, but that the preva-
lence of sin in men was less noticed until the law was ordained
anew by Moses 3 but that after the law was ordained, the reign of
death ceased, and the reign of sin began, because the power of
sin was observed by men, and because it was a just thing with
God that they should die. The same thing is taught by the
apostle in ehap. vii. 9 of this epistle :-“ Without the law sin
was dead,'’ i.e. ‘ was not seen to reign,' ‘⁴ and I was alive‚'’ or ⁶ I
seemed to myself worthy of life 3 so that it was from the tyranny
and reign of death that I died ε’ “But when the commandment
came,'' that is ‘ after the law was ordained,’ “ sin revived,'' or ‘ the
reign of sin attracted my observation,' (ζ and I died,'' or ‘ I seemed
in my own judgment worthy of death ;' so that after the law had
been ordained through Moses, it was not death but sin that
tyrannized and reigned. Hence also the apostle elsewhere says
that the law slew him until having become dead to the law, Christ
raised him again, to live unto God, under the reign of grace or
“ the kingdom of God and of heaven.’' The apostle thus divides
the duration of the world into three reiyns .· the reign of death stom
Adam to Moses 3 the reign of sin from the law· to Christ, as he
speaks, ehap. vi. 123 and the reign of yrace from Christ for
ever, which in Rev. xii. 10, is called the kingdom of God and the
power of his Christ. ‘⁶ Even over them who have not sinned after
the likeness of Adam’s transgression.” He goes on to illustrate the
assumption of the last syllogism‚ viz„ ‘ that death had reigned srom
Adam to Moses,' by a comparison of majority =—‘ death reigned not
only over those who sinned actually, as did Adam, but even over
those who could not sin in like manner, on account of their age,
as infants unconscious of the law? By this the apostle would
,teaeh us that the law, the transgression of which is sin, reaches
