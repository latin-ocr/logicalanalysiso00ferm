162 LOGICAL ANALYSIs or THE

promiseS, 'with the other prerogatives which we have enumerated,
have been effectually given, do not reject the salvation through
J esus Christ long before promised, and now fully made manifest?
The antecedent is given in the commencement of this ssth verse,
amplified by a comparison of lninorityz—-‘ the word of God not
only has not failed, but it cannot be that it has failed? The con-
sequent is omitted, but, being sufficiently obvious from the ante-
cedent, gives rise to three prolepses. “For they are not all Israel
that are of Israel, (as their father).’' This is the first prolepsis
and prevention of objection :--‘ According to your opinion, there-
fore,’ the adversaries might object, ‘all Israelites are not true
Israelites 3 but some are Israelites in truth, others in name only :'
this the opponents assume to be absurd, and consequently reject,
as good for nothing, the foregoing reply of the apostle, founded
upon a distinction between different descriptions of Israelites.

and maintaining that it is not only not absurd or paradoxical, but,
on the contrary, most certain that all “ who are of Israel” as their
father, that is, ‘ who are descended from Israel according to the
flesh,' are not “ Israel‚'’ or ‘ that people of God to whom the en-

remainder of the verse 3 and although it is only a repetition of
what the apostle had more explicitly stated concerning the Jews
in the 28th and 29th verses of chap. ii., yet inasmuch as it appears
paradoxical and absurd to these opponents, arguing for the people
of the law, that there should be any one “ of Israel” who is not
also Israel in truth, he enlarges upon the proof of this reply.

7. “ N either, because they are the seed of Abraham, are ‚they
(therefore) all children3 but in Isaac shall thy seed be called.''
:The argument by which he proves it is taken from an induction of
similar examples, of which there are two. The first is that of the
house „of Abraham, from which the apostle reasonS, as is usually
done, and ought always to be done in the case of extended
example& by a threefold' process. For, first of all, he deduces·
