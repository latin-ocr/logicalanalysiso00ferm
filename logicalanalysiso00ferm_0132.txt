90 LoeloAL ANALYSISOF THE

whilst we are in this world, our body is a body of sin and death,
and will not be without sin so long as we continue here3 neverthe-
less, he admonishes us not to allow it to reign. “ That ye should
obey it,’' viz„ ⁶ sin,’ “in the lusts there0f,'⁷ viz., ‘of the body-⁹
This is an epexegesis,* whereby he explains his rule, and what it
is for sin to reign in our body, viz.—‘ that the obedience which
we render to sin in fulfilling the lusts of the body, proves the reign
of sin therein 3' as our Lord also teaches us in John viii. 34, when

from the removal of the dominion of the law, which is the cause of
the dominion of sin:

‘ All those, over whom sin has dominion, are under the domi-
nion of the law 3' or thus :—‘ Sin shall not have dominion over any
