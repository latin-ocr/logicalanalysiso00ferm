78 LOGICAL ANALYSIS OF THE

remission of sins. The apostle calls the gunt—‘⁶ that which en-
tered through one that sinned,’' and the remission——“ the benefit,
or, as he afterwards speaks—‘ that which God freely bestows
through that One who made satisfaction for sin.' From this we
should observe that according to the mind of the apostle, as that
one man J esus Christ is the free gift of Grod7 and that which God
freely bestows, so also is the remission of sins, and whatever God
confers on us in Christ, a free gift, so far as we are concerned and
in respect to sus, although in respect to Christ it is a reward.
“ For the guilt indeed is from one (offence) unto condemnation3
but that which (God) freely bestows is from many offences unto
justification.’' We have next the proof of the second dissimilitude,
which like the effects (as already remarked) is twofold. The first
proof is :——‘ The guilt is from one fall or sin, but the remission is
of many, yea, of all sins, in the case of those who believe :—

⁶ Therefore not as the guilt or that which entered through one
that sinned‚ so is the remission or benefit which God freely be-
stows in Christ?

Each side of the comparison is amplified by its end ε the end of
the guilt is ζ condemnation 3' but of the benefit from many sins, or
the remission of sins—‘ our justification ς’ for our sins are remitted
in order that we may be justified.

17. ‘⁴ For if by one offence death reigned through one, much
more those who receive the abundance of grace, and the gift of
righteousness, shall reign in life through one, Christ J esus.’' This
is the second proof of the second dissimilitude‚ from the secondary
effects of the fall and of grace, which are ‘ death,’ and ‘eternal
life’ or ‘ reigning with Christ in life eternal.’ This argument like
the former is from a comparison of minority 2—-

‘If through one fall death reigned through one, or through the
fall of one man, much more those who receive superabounding
grace shall reign in life through one, J esus Christ :

‘ But the former is manifest 3

‘ Therefore so is the latter?
