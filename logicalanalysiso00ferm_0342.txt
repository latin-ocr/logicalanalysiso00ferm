44 Having considered the season.’' The common argument, both
for what goes before, and for the common conclusion which fol-
lows, is taken from the adjunct of the season3 whence the apostle
thus argues :——— ’

4 If it is now time that we should awake from the sleep of sin
to love each other always, and to perform every duty to all, both
in the Church and in the State, we should now awake from the
sleep of sin to every duty, and to love each other always 3
. ⁴ But the former is true :

⁴ T herefore so is also the latter?

By ⁴⁴ sleep” I understand here—⁴ death in sin,' according to the
explanation of this apostle himself, in Ephes. iv. 14 3 where, after
he has quoted from Isaiah the words,-—⁴⁴ Awake, thou that sleep-

sleeps in sin awakes to duty3 and he who was dead in sin rises
again to love always. ⁴⁴ For now is our salvation nearer than
when we believed.'’ This is the reason of the preceding assump-

from the adjunct of ⁴ the nearness' of salvation—⁴⁴ now ;'' which
is set forth and illust-rated by„a comparison of majority :-——“ now
is our salvation nearer''—that is, 4 nearer to us'—⁴‘ than when we
believed-'⁹ For the understanding of this proof we must expound‚
in’the first place, the time indicated by the adverb--⁴⁴ now ς* then
the time at which they are said to have 44 believed ;’' and, in the
third place, we must enquire what is denoted by the term ‘⁴ salva-
tion.’' By 44 now'’ (νυν) Ι consider is indicated—⁴ the time of the
appearing of the gospeL’ By 4 the time at which they are said to
