‘ But you are the sons of God’—as has been already proved :

‘ Therefore you are also heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ?

From this, as we formerly said, the apostle infers—⁴ that we are
in Christ J esus,’ which is the first part of the assumption, as was
remarked on verse 14. “ If so be that we suffer with him.” This

heritance with Christ, namely——‘ our participation With Christ in
his cross, and our holy confirmation with him under the cross:
⁴⁶ That we may be also glorified along with him '’——an illustration
of the annexed condition from its end.

The mention of the above condition leads the apostle into a
digressionjin which he encourages those who are in Christ, or
who are joint heirs with him, to suffer with Christ. The *argu-
ments which he employs for this purpose are two : the one taken
from a comparison of inequality between our sufferings and the glory
by which they are followed3 the other from the issue or end of
these sufferings‚ viz. that they work for our good ι upon the first
of which arguments the apostle dwells from this 18th verse to verse
283 upon the second from verse 28, to verse 31. The first argu-
ment is proleptical 3 there is therefore, in these words, a prolepsis
whereby he anticipates an objection suggested by the condition of.
the inheritance spoken of in the verse immediately preceding :—
‘Are we then,’ an objector might ask, ‘ to procure that inheritance
by our own sufferings, when throughout the whole of the con-
structive reasoning of your first discussion, you have established
the contrary, viz—that the inheritanoe is from saith through
grace-(c. iv. 16), and neither stom our own works nor sufferings,
otherwise grace would be no longer grace, (o. xi. 6)?’ To this
objection the apostle, in these' words, thus forcibly replies, in order-
