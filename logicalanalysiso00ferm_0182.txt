140 LocmAL ANALYSIS or THE

‘But if the sighs of the spirit are unutterable, then they are
not comprehended nor understood :

‘ Therefore, if these sighs are unutterable, they are of no avail,
and afford no relief to the saints?

To this objection, the apostle replics by the negation of the as-
sumption3 and in the verse before us he adduces this reason for
the negation, viz.-—that God understands the sense of his own
Spirit [interceding] on our behalf: wherefore, although these sighs
are unutterable, and surpass, as we have just said, both the sense
and speech of the creature3 yet the apostle would have us know
that they are comprehended by God. In proof of this, two argu-
ments are here brought forward. The first is taken from the na-
ture of God:

‘ God is acquainted with * and searcheth our hearts3

‘ Therefore, although the sighs are unutterable, yet God knows
what is the sense of his Spirit in these sighs τ’

This is therefore a consolation to those who, like the Psalmist,
are so agitated with afflictions, that they cannot fully express
themselves3 but no excuse for such as mock God with an idiom
which they do not understand, and by a designed and studied ig-
norance. “Because he intercedeth for the saints agreeably to
God.'’ This is the second argument by which the apostle proves
that the sense of the Spirit in the unutterable sighs of the pious is
not only known to God, but also 'owned by him 3 that is—‘ that
these sighs of the saints, proceeding from his own Spirit, are
grateful and acceptable to him? The argument is taken from the
adjunct of the intercession by means of these sighs: it is κατ-οὶ
Θεὸν, that is—-‘ conformable to the will of God? The apostle ae-
cordingly thus reasons :—

All intercession, in whatever manner it is made, whether by
words or sighs, if it be made agreeably to the will of God, (naq-02
Θεδν) is comprehended by God, yea owned by and acceptable to
him ;

4 But this intercession of the Spirit in our behalss' he subjoins
