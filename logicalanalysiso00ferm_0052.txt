10 LOGICAL ANALYsls OF THE

eousness,'' and not ‘man’s,' because it is the gift of God, not the
merit of man z So that the sense of the proposition is———‘ that that
is the power of God unto salvation by which is revealed that ‘⁴ free
gift of G0d‚’' (as our Lord speaks, John iv. 10‚) ‘whereby being
justified, we are made partakers of God’s salvation.' To this the
apostle subjoins the assumption in the text: “For through it,”
that is, ζ through the gospel,⁷ ⁴⁴ God's righteousness,’' or ‘the free
gift of God, by which, being justified, we are made partakers of
God’s salvation‚’ “ is revealed.'' This assumption he proves by
two arguments, both from testimony. The first is that of the
Church, both of ancient and modern times 3 for so Ι understand
the words, “from faith to saith :’' this namely was the belief of
the ancient Church—‘ that righteousness was revealed by the gos-
pelas made known in the promises ς’ and the same continues to
be the belief of the modern Church, viz. :—-‘ that the righteous-
ness of God is revealed in the gospel now more fully made known.'
That this is the true interpretation,appears from Acts xv. 10, 11,
--“ Why tempt ye God,'' says Peter, “by putting a yoke on the
neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers, (that is ‘ the
ancient Church’) nor we (Christ being now made known) have
been able to bear 3 since we believe that through the grace of the
Lord J esus, we (the modern and Evangelical Church,) shall be
saved even as they, (the Church of the fathers ;'') Peter, therefore,
says,—‘ that it was the common belief both of the ancient Church‚
and after them of our’s under the gospel, that God’s righteousness
has been revealed by the gospel? To this agrees what Paul says,
Gal. ii. 15, 16,-“ we who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of
the Gentiles,’' that is, ‘who are the ancient Church, and have
the promises,' ‘⁴ knowing that a man is not justified from the works
of the law, but from the saith of J esus Christ, even we,’' namely,
‘ the ancient Church,' says Paul, “have believed on J esus Christ,
that we might be justified from the faith of Christ? So I take it
the apostle speaks in this place, as if he had said,—-‘ that God's
righteousness is revealed by the gospel, is not a modern doctrine

unheard of by our fathers, but is from saith to saith, that is, hav· » “
