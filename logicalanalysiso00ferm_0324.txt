282 LoeloAL ANALYSIS OF THE

turbance of the peace of the Church. The occasion sometimes
proceeds from the Church herself 3 but the cause is always found in
the wicked: just as the occasion of Abimelech’s death proceeded
from himself, and the duty which he piously performed to David3
whereas the cause was found in Saul, who could not hear a word
about duty performed to David, on account of the evil disposition
by which he was actuated towards him. And from this we learn
another difference between the cause and occasion of the distur-
bance of the peace of the Church3 the cause is always accompanied
with sin3 but the occasion may be without sin, inasmuch as it may
be impossible to avoid either deserting our duty, or giving occasion
to a wicked world to disturb our peace. The apostle therefore
commands us to cultivate peace—‘⁴ if it be possible 3⁹⁹ intimating
that it is often impossible, if we keep the path of duty in which
it behoves us to persevere. Secondly, we are to observe from the
apostle here—that whenever an occasion for disturbing our peace
can be avoided without sin, it ought to be avoided: for so the
apostle speaks—‘ cultivate peace as much as lieth in you3' that
is--‘ as far as you can avoid an occasion for the disturbance of
your peace without sin, avoid it.⁹ And it is most worthy of ob-
servation, in the third place—that the Christian cannot do that
which he is unable to do without sin: for so the apostle here says,
that sometimes it does not ‘lie in us’ to avoid an occasion for the
disturbance of eur peace3 inasmuch as that often cannot be done
without sin on our part.

Thus far we have had the relation or respect of which others are
the subject, according to which the apostle has commended to
Christians the various duties incumbent upon them: next comes
the second relation and respect, which is seen in Christians them-
selves, whom the apostle therefore calls his “ beloved ;'’ according
to which relation or respect of which they are themselves the sub—
jects, there devolves upon them a duty to be performedvto others,
in the Lord, and that the gospel of God, which they profess, may
be well spoken of even among those that are without, when they
see that duty performed by them. According to this respect
