nms'rLE OF PAUL To THE ROMANS. 299

duty towards every man with whom he lives, whether in the Church
and as a member of the Chureh, or in the State and as a member
of the State? And Ι am induced to take thisview of the passage
by the twofold reference of this llth verse: for in it the apostle
proves, at one and the same time, both that which he has chiefly
proved, viZ.—‘ that we should owe no man anything, except (this)
to love one another,' and that which follows next in order, in verses
12 and 13, namely, the conclusion of his discourse, which is-‘ that
we should cast off the works of darkness? And this twofold re-
ference of the verses before us is manifest, partly from the first
clause of the verse-—“ and that, having considered the season”——
wherein he repeats what has been said at the beginning of verse
8th, via—⁴ that we should owe no man anything except (this‚)
to love one another ς’ so that the meaning is—‘ and that Ι advise,’
or ‘ and this I say, owe no man anything, except to love one an-
other, having considered the season which is now presented—hav-
ing considered it, namely, yourselves—as Ι the apostle have con-
sidered and observed it 3’ for the plural participle εἰδότες indicates,
that this observation of the season (καιροῦ) is to be referred to the
Romans themselves also, to whom he writes, thus——‘ yon, knowing
and observing with me the present season, ought to owe no man
anything, except to love one another.' This is the first reference
of this llth verse. The second, or that whereby this verse refers
to what follows, is manifest from the particle οὖν in the latter part
of verse 12; which indicates, that the admonition there given—
“let us cast off the works of darkness'’-—is„ as it were, deduced
from what precedes, by reasoning stom the same observation of the
season in the beginning of verse 11 z so that the meaning is-—‘ let
ue, namely‚ you and me together, cast off the works of darkness-⁹
In this last section of the chapter, therefore, we have, in the first
place, in verse 11, and the beginning of verse 12, the argument for
the common conclusion, which is also a second argument for the
foregoing injunction--“ owe no man anything‚ except to love one
another ;'' in the second place, we have, in the middle of the 12th
verse, the common conclusion itself 3 which is then explained by
