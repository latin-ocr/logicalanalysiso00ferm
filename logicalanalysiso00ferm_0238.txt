196 LocchL ANALYSIS or THE

“ By whom he is invoked.” This is an epanorthosis of the fore-
going antecedent, whereby the apostle shews that these riches of
the mercy of God extend to all, indeed, yet not to individuals of
classes, but to classes of individuals,-—that is, to the elect from
amongst all, both Jews and Gentiles,——who are here described by
their effect, viZ.—‘ their invocation of the name of God :’—-

‘ God is rich in mercy towards all; but, by “ all,'’ I mean only

believed? and how shall they believe on him of whom they have
not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher‘?

15. “ And how shall they preach unless they have been sent ?”
This is the third argument whereby the apostle proves ‘ that the
zeal of the Israelites is not according to knowledge,' to which he
has made a transition by the foregoing epanorthosis‚ and testimony
of the prophet concerning the certain salvation of all that invoke
