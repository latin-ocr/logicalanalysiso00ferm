ErxsTLE or PAUL To THE nonme. 363

1. “ Moreover I commend unto you Phoebe,” 800. The apostle
first amplifies, and then assigns a reason for his commendation.
The amplification is taken, first of all, from its subject, and next,
from its end. The subject of Paul’s commendation here is Plzoebe:
--“ I commend,” says the apostle, ‘⁴ to you (who are in Rome),⁷’
or ‘ to the Roman ehureh'-—-that is, ‘ Ι commit to your care, zeal,
and assistance—⁴⁴ Phoebe our sister.’' We have here an illustra-
tion of Phoebe from two adjuncts, namelyz——first, her common, and
secondly, her particular vocation. Her common vocation is indi-
cated by the apostle's calling her—⁴⁴ our sister ;'' that is—‘ the
daughter, through saith, of the same God with us who believe on
Christ? But ‘ to be the daughter of God in Christ, and through
partnership in the common faith, the sister of believers,' is the
common vocation of a Christian female. Phoebe, therefore, is first
of all described from the ciremnstanee—-‘ that she is a Christian
female, the daughter of God‚ and the sister of all who believe,
through faith in Christ? That is her common vocation. ‘⁶ Who is
a minister to the church at Cenchrea.'’ This is her particular
·vocation; she was, it appears, among the ‘wido'ws’ of the Cen-
chrean church: unless you prefer to say, what seems more correctly
said, that she was—‘ one who ministered to the ehurch of Cen-
chrea, by hospitably entertaining pious strangers3' from which class
of females, the apostle teaches, in 1 Tim. v. 10, that awidow should
be chosen.

2. “That ye may receive her.'’ This is the second amplifi-
cation of the eommendation of Paul, taken from the end, and that
twofold, for which he has commended Phoebe to the Romanss
chureh: the first end is—‘ that they should receive her when she
vearne to Rome ς’ the second—‘ that they should assist her! “ In
*the Lord.” This is a clearing of the first end3 in which there are

⁷ ‚two arguments. The first is intimated in those words: for to

receive her ‘⁴ in the Lord‚'’ is to receive her——‘ as engrafted on the
Lon-d through faith, and for the sake of the Lord on whom she is
engraftedss The first argument of the clean-ing may therefore be
