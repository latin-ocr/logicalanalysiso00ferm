EPISTLE OF PAUL TO THE ROMANs. 37

Christian men to abstain from blasphemous objections against the
truth.

6. “Far from it”—-the second part of the reply, in which he
rejects the conclusion with abhorrence.-‘ Far be it from me that
I should think or teach that it is unjust in God to punish our
unrighteousness, lying, and unbeliefi’ ‘⁴ Else how shall God be
the judge of the world ?”—the third part of the reply, containing a
proof of the negative of the proposition from the received and
common testimony concerning God. For the apostle takes for
granted, from the common opinion of al] men, especially of the
Jews, who had been taught out of the law, that God will be the
judge of the world z and he here enquires how this common testi-
mony can be consistent3 intimating that it is impossible it can
be consistent with the blasphemous proposition of the last syllo-
gism of the Jews.

7, 8. “ For if the truth of God hath redounded by my lying to
his glory, why arn I still condemned as a sinner?” This is the
second part of the prolepsis, expressed by a comparison of majo-
rity: ⁶ If the truth of God redounds by my lying to his glory,
not only am Ι not to be condemned as a sinner, but evil is to be
done that good may come 3 ’ that is—‘ I must follow after sin with
the greater zeal, that God may be the more glorified by my un-
righteousness.' ⁷ ¹

‘ But you, Paul, assert the former ε ’

‘Therefore you affirm the latter also, viz—that evil is to be

done that good may come?
The proposition with the conclusion are given in the text ; the

Δ conclusion being amplified by the false and slanderous testimony

of many, and inserted within a parenthesis.

“' Whose condemnation is just.’' To this syllogism, as being ¹
manifestly absurd, the apostle makes no reply, but opposes the
just condemnation of God to those who falsely charged him with
the conclusion. ·
