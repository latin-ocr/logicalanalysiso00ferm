here, therefore, is not of individuale from among the Gentiles, but
of individual Gentile nations with individual Jews 3 and the apos-
tle’s meaning is z——‘ that the apostacy of the Gentiles, under the
tyranny and darkness of Antichrist, will proceed so far, that there
shall be no entire and whole nation among them which shall pre-
serve the light of the gospel pure ;.whilst-, on the contrary, in the
falling away of the Jewish nation, there shall remain among them
both many sons of light, and even some sincere preachers of the
gospel,' of whom, the apostle, in the first verse of this chap., pro-
fesses himself to be one, and, in our own day, we have seen Im-
manuel Tremellius to be another. The apostle, moreover, pur-
posely makes the comparison in this way3 and, here, when he is
speaking of the hardening of the Jews, expresses the note of limi-
tion (ἀπ-ὂ μέζους) which he omitted in predicting the apostacy of
the Gentiles, in order that he may the more effectually repress
(which is the design of this passage) the triumphing of the Gen-
tiles against the Jews. “ Until the fulness of the Gentiles should
⁴come in.” This is the. second part of the assumption, the mean-
ing of which is—‘ that hardening has happened to I'srael, not
for ever, nor until the end, but for a definite portion of future
time? This portion of time the apostle defines by its subject—-
‘ the coming in of the fulness of the Gentiles,’ that is ‘ the draw-
ing near of all the Gentiles, or the elect out of individua] Gentile
nations, to J esus Christ their Saviour, through the gospel call3'
which coming in, or drawing near of the Gentiles, the Lord pre-
dicts, in Matt. xxiv. 14, would precede the end and his second
coming. The mystery, therefore, which the apostle here anf-
nounces to the Gentiles, is this :—‘ that God has defined the num-
ber which he is about to call out of all the Gentiles, by the
’ preaching of the gospel of the kingdom, that they may become
partakers of the grace of Christ 3 and that, although in themselves,
these called from among the Gentiles are not a people, and a rei·
bellious people, yet, being led, through the gospel, to the obe÷
dience of saith, they shall become the people of God, in orderthixt

the Jews, who have been hardened until the fulness of the (ἔθυε- ,ς
