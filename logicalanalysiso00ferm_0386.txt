344 Loe1CAL ANALYSIS or THE

Holy Spirit, who spoke in Moses3 whence, under the guidance of
the same Spirit, he renders the words of Moses thus :—-“ Rejoice,
ye Gentiles with his people.'’*

11. In the third scripture, also, the apostle deduces the cause
from its effect, or the calling of the Gentiles to salvation in com-
mon with Israel, from the fact—‘ that the Holy Spirit, by the
psalmist, in Ps. cxvii., had long before exhorted the Gentiles, as
well as the people of Israel, to praise ‚Jehovah for that salvation ς’
which ⁴ praising' is the effect of salvation bestowed.

And from these two things—viz, ‘ the extension of the kingdom>

Gentiles to the kingdom of Christ.

13. “ (I wish,) moreover, that the God of hope may fill you with

amplification, viZ.—-‘ that J esus Christ is minister to announce
the truth of God both to the circumcised and to the Gentiles,’—
this conclusion, Ι say, or rather the latter part of it, namely-—‘ that
J esus Christ has been made God’s minister to the Gentiles,' having
been established by various testimonies of scripture ; he now com-

* Ingenious as this explanation is, it is'more probable that the apostle quotes d'i-

which signifies‘ ‘wit-h‚” before myst ‘his peop1e;’' and which may, aster all, be the
true reading. —Transl.
