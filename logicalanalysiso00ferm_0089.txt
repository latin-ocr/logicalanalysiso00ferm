EPISTLE OF PAUL TO THE ROMANS. 47

time he had borne with the Gentiles, great sinners though they
were, in order that that righteousness of his might be manifested
in their posterity? ‘⁴ That he might be just, and the justifier of
him who is of the faith of Jesus.” We have here the fourth and
last part of the description of Jesus Christ, which was begun in
the verse immediately preceding. It is drawn from the remote
end [of his incarnation and sacrifice] which is the consistency and
harmony ot the justice and mercy of God in the justification of us
sinners- For unless God were just as well as the justifier of us
sinners in J esus Christ set forth for a propitiation through saith
in his blood, then neither we ourselves, nor any created being in
our name, could make satisfaction for our sins: but J esus Christ,
having been set forth by the Father for a propitiation, has so fully
satisfied divine justice for all the sins of all believers, that God,
in justifying us who believe in J esus, of his own pure grace and
mercy, is himself also most just. One thing should be observed
here, vi2., that what the apostle, in these two verses, calls “his
righteousness,” is not—⁴ that by which God is righteous in him-
self,’ nor—⁶ that by which he is declared righteous in executing
judgment on wicked sinners,⁷ but—⁴ that whereby he fieely treats
us as righteous,' in other words—‘ the righteousness which is stee-
ly given by him in Christ, who alone has made satisfaction and
earned righteousness (for us.)'

27. “ Where is glorying then? It is excluded. Through what
law? Of works‘? N ay ; but through the law of faith.’' This is a
winding up and conclusion drawn from the foregoing and already
inferred conclusion of the principal assumption. That conclusion,
as we have said above on verse 20, was—⁶ that no flesh can be
j‘ustifled from the works of the law z ’ from which the apostle now
deduces another conclusion, viz.,—‘ that all glorying is excluded
through faith? This he here discusses un'der the. form of a dia-
logue, and by contraries3 the substance being-J that all glorying

in the flesh is excluded, not through the law of works, but through ¹

the law of saith?
