EPISTLE OF PAUL TO THE ROMANS. 159

styled-—“ the constitution of the law,”(vofho()eo'loe) because through
it the Israelitish state was constituted by God as its king. The
third or ζ ceremonia] law' is called ‘⁴ the service‚” (λατξὲια) or
‘ministry‚' because in its observance and practice, a great part, not
to say the whole, of the externa] and typical ministry carried on
among that people consisted. The fourth prerogative of Israel is
—“ the promises‚'’ which that people alone of all the nations pos-
sessed, (Eph. ii. 12 3) under the name of which promises, I un-
derstand—‘ the word of faith and of the covenant of grace,' which
having been promised to Israel ‘⁶ in divers manners‚” (Heb. i. 1,)
was at length fully made manifest in the gospel. The fifth prero-
gative is that they were descended from those fathers—Abraham,
Isaac and Jacob—who were beloved of God, and with whom he
entered into covenant, (Deut. x. 15.) The last and most distin-
guished prerogative of this people is—‘ that from them was Christ 3⁷⁹
and this prerogative is amplified by an explanation both of Christ,
and of his descent from Israel. By hysterosis, his descent is first
of all explained by its subject which is his “flesh‚'' or ‘human
nature 3' so that Christ was descended from Israel, not as regarded
his whole person, as these opponents‚ knowing nothing of his divine
nature, imagined‚ but in part only, and as regarded his other nature.
The second part- of the illustration, or the description of Christ him—
self, is taken, first of all, from that nature of his of which the un-
believing vvere ignorant :—he is the one “ God,” and the same God
with his Father and the Holy Spirit3 secondly‚ from his glory,
which is explained from the less, by a comparison with that of crea-

tures—he is “ to be blessed above all ;'’ thirdly, from the eternity ·

both of himself and of his glory “for ever,’' and lastly‚ from an ex-
pression of approbation or a confession of faith on him, which is
here indicated by the particle ‘⁴ Amen.'’

’ With this description of ,J esus Christ at the close of the 5th
verse, commences the second part of the apostle's reply to the
leading objection, which has been stated under verse 1. The

apostle, therefore, 'replies in the second place, to that objection, by -

denying the consequence of the enthymeme, or proposition of the
