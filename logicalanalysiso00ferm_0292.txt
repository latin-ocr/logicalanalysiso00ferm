250 LOGICAL ANALYSIS or THE

here alluded to, I understand—‘ that new life, which is ours through
the regeneration of the Spirit,' and which, in Gal. ii. 20, is called—-
‘ the life of God ε’ the apostle, therefore, bids us take heed to our-
selves, and seek, when we offer ourselves to God, that we may per-
ceive the life of God begun and advancing within uss “Holy.”
By the second quality, the sacrifice of Christiane is distinguished
from the sacrifices of the Gentiles, among whom both religion, and
life with men, which are the two branches of the new obedience
or offering here enjoined, were most full of defilement, from which
the apostle bids Christians take heed that their sacrifice be ‘⁴ holy''
or separated3 as he also charges at length, in Eph. iv., ver. 17 to
25 ε for the ‘ sanctification,’ either of a person or thing, is ⁶ the se-
paration of that person or thing from the defflement of a perishing
world? This sanctification or separation of the sacrifice from de-
filement, was shadowed forth by the sacrifice under the law, which,
by the command of God, behoved to be without spot or imperfec-
tion, (Dent. xv. 21 ς) also, by the cleanness of those who offered,
and those who brought the sacrifice ε for it was unlawful for any
one to present himself under the laW, unless he was pure according
to the purification which the law required ; [as we learn fronti]
Numb. ix. 6, where those who had been defiled by the dead body
of a man are kept back from celebrating the passover of J ehovah
on the fourteenth day of the first month, and are put off to the
fourteenth day of the second month, that, having been first made
clean, they might then present themselves to Jehovah. “ Accep-
table unto God.” This is the third quality, whereby the sacrifice
of those who are Christiane in truth is distinguished from the sac—
rifice, that is, from the service and life of all who are not in Christ
J esus, whether they be idolaters, without the pale of the visible
Church, or heretics‚ or utter hypocfites, within its bosom. These '
are altogether an abomination and abhorrence to God, both as re-
gards themselves and their religion and life—“ I have no delight
in you, saith J ehovah of hosts, and I accept not an offering at your
hand,'’ (Mal. i. 10 ς) ‘ whosoever are not in Christ ς’ and that tbe- ’
cause both the offex-ers, and whatever is offered by them, are im-
