EPISTLE OF PAUL TO THE ROMANS. 65

raised up for our justification.” This is a description of J esus our
Lord, who was raised up from the dead, from two adjuncts : the
first is—‘ the delivering of him to death,’ which is put by synec-
doche for his whole passion 3 the second—‘ the raising of him again
from the dead,’ which, in like manner, is put by synecdoche for his
whole glorification, as it is expressed in the gospel and ereed. Each
of these adjuncts of Christ is illustrated, separately, by its end.
His death was—⁴ because of our sins ς’ that is, Christ died, that
by dying he might make full satisfaction for all the sins of us who
believe. His resurrection again was for our justification ; that is,
Christ was raised from the dead that he might be able to apply to
us the ransom, * and redemption price which he procured by his
death z for if he had himself had remained under the power of death,
the ransom procured by his dying would not have availed us for
righteousness and life 3 but having died for us, and being alive
again, he applies the price of his death for righteousness and life
to us. In this description of Christ there is contained a third
argument in proof of the leading conclusion, viz„ our justification by
saith 3 to which the apostle makes a transition by the foregoing de-
scription of God from his operation, in v. 24. immediately preceding.
This argument is apodictical ssand is taken from the first or neces-
sary and the proximate cause of our justification and life, viz,—
‘the death and resurrection of J esus Christ? The syllogism of
this argument, which is made up of reciproca] propositions through-
out, is as follows :—

‘ All who are justified and attain the inheritance, by the death
and resurrection of J esus Christ, are justified and live, not by
works, but by faith on him who died and rose again,' or, as the
apostle speaks, ‘ on him who raised up Christ from the dead ;
But all of us who are partakers of life and righteousness are justi-
fied through the death and resurrection of J esus Christ,' (which
assumption is implied in the words of the apostle in ,the text—-
“who was delivered, &c.”) that is--‘ being washed from our sins
through the death and resurrection of J esus Christ, we are justi-
