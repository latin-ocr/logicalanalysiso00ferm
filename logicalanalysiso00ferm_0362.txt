320 LOGICAL ANALYSIS OF THE

‘Therefore he is Lord of all, and all are his servants, in life and
in death.'

By “ the living,'’ I understand here, as above—‘ believers,’ the end
of whose life is the glory and honour of God. The apostle seems also
to use the term “ death” here, in a wider acceptation, extending it
not only to believers in death, but also to the spiritually dead and
dying3 of whom the apostle says, that ‘they die to the Lord,’ inas-
much as it is the Lord, and none else, from whom those who die
spiritually fall away in their death, and consequently, by whom
alone, as sinning against him only in so dying, they are to be judged.

10. Thus far, from the 4th verse, the apostle has interdicted any
one in the Church from judging or condemning another, by an argu-
ment drawn from the right of J esus Christ alone, who is Lord of
all, and whose servants we all are, and, consequently, whose prero-
gative alone it is to judge all, to condemn those who are to be eon-
demned, and to justify those who are to be justified. He now
proceeds in this, and the following vv. as far as the latter part of
ver. 13, to interdict the same by an argument drawn from our-
selves, and that twofold. The first argument is taken from this-
⁴ that we are all to stand before the judgment-seat of Christ the
judge, none of us before the judgment-seat of another3’ and the
apostle thus reasons 3- ,

. ‘If we are all to stand before the judgment-seat of Christ the
judge, none of us, as judge, should either condemn or make light
of his brother3

‘ But the former is true:

⁴ Therefore, so is the latter?

. “But thou, why dost thou condemn thy brother? 01· even thou, ,
why dost thou make light of thy brother ?” This is the conclusion„
of the syllogism, adorned with a rhetorical interrogation, whereby
the apostle extorts 'from all who believe, the confession—‘thav
none should condemn, and none despise his brother? “For-⁷ we
shall all standbefore the judgment-seat of Christ? This is the*

assumption of the 'syllogism.
