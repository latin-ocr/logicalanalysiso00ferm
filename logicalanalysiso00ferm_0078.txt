36 LOGICAL ANALYSIS OF THE

need not only for the exhibition of the oracles of God, but also for
our apprehension of them by faith, which is the work of the Holy

. Spirit.

- 4. “ Yea let God be true, but every man a liar.'' The apostle
here amplifies the foregoing assumption by a comparison of ma-
jority z—the lying of all men will not render void the faith of God,
since were every man a liar, yet God himself remains true 3 much
less therefore can the unbelief of some men render void the saith
of God. “ As it is written, That thou mayest be justified in thy
sayings and mayest overcome when thou judgest.’' He proves
the comparison of majority by the testimony of scripture, and
that twofold: the first part proves that God is true, for he
who is justified in his sayings is true3 the second that man is a
liar, for if the Lord overcomes when he judges, then is man over-
come, i. e., he is found a liar and a covenant-breaker when he is

judged. '

5. “ But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of
God what shall we say Ῥ Is God unjust who inflicteth punishment ?’'
Because it appears from the foregoing reply, that the lying and
unbelief of men cannot render void the saith of God, but that the
saith, and truth, and righteousness of God are manifested by the
unbelief, lying and unrighteousness of man, there hence arises a
fourth prolepsis consisting of two parts : The first being contained
in verses 5 and 6, the second in verses 7 and 8. The first part is,—
‘ If our unrighteousness‚’ say the Jews, ‘ commend the righteousness
of God, our lying the truth of God‚ and our unbelief the faith of God,
it is unjust that the Lord should punish our unbelief, lying and un-
righteousness 3 you, Paul, assert the former 3 therefore the latter fol-
lows.'’ “ I speak after the manner of men.’' We have next a three-
fold reply of the apostle: first, he excuses himself for having stated an
objection of this kind, and says that it was not started by his own
mind, but by the mind of men, i.e. “ sensual men,'’ and “men of
corrupt judgment‚’' as he elsewhere speaks 3 whereby he warns
