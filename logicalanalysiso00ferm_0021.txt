LIFE OF FERME. XV

1592 a charter from the Crown, in which full powers were given to
him and to his heirs to erect and endow a college and university,
to appoint, place, or remove Officers of all kinds requisite for such
an institution, and to make and enforce all statutes needful for its
due order and working. The same immunities and privileges were
secured to this projected institution as were enjoyed by the exist-
ing universitics of the realm3 and in 1597 the Parliament gave its
approbation to the institution, highly commending the patriotic
liberality of the founder, and confirming him in all the rights con—
ferred on him by the royal charter.

Anxious to secure for his infant college a Principal of approved
character and experience, Sir Alexander invited Ferme to the
office, and, at the same time, as patron of the church of Fraser-
burgh, offered him the situation of minister of that parish. Ferme
probably hesitated before accepting a post of so much responsibi-
lity and labour3 it is certain that he declared to the Genera] As-
sembly of the Church that he would not accept it without their
command to do so. There seems also to have been some hesita-
tion in issuing such a command, on the part of that venerable body
when the matter came before them at their session of 21st March
1600, in consequence of a “ supplicatione given in be the Pres-

bytry of Deir ;’' but “having considered the necessity of the

,. said worke, and how the said Laird of Phillorthe hes refusit to sus-

tain ane pastor at the said kirk, unless he undertake both the saids
charges? they at length resolved to “command and charge the
said Mr Charles Ferme to undertake and awayte upon, alsweill the

, said kirk‚ as to be Principall of the Colledge of Fraserburgh.'’*
