EPISTLE OF PAUL To THE ROMAN& 71

‘ because he is the gift of God in Christ J esus.’ The apostle here-
by teaehes us this lesson, that by the same grace and love of God
into which we are restored through J esus Christ, his Holy Spirit
being given to us works in us both knowledge and feeling, which
the apostle here calls—⁴ a shedding forth in our hearts.'

6. “ For Christ, when we were yet without strength, in his own
time died for the ungodly.'' We have next the proof of the love
of God, thus shed forth and superabounding, from its effect in
giving up to death for us our Lord J esus Christ in whom he loves
us, and in whom we are reconciled. This death the apostle here
variously amplifies. First, from the voluntary offer whereby J esus
Christ gave himself up to death 3 as our Lord teaches us, John x.
18, and. which the apostle here intimates when he says that ζ( Christ
died,” that is—‘ was given up to death by the Father, and volun-
tarily gave up himself to death.’ Secondly, from the adjunet of
the time, and that twofold: first, in respect of ourselves—‘when
we were yet without strength' 3 next in respect of himself—⁴ when
his own time came,’ “the full time,” and ζ( the time predetermin-
ed by the father,’' as the apostle says, Gal. iv. 4. From this ad-
junct of thetime the apostle would have us leam our inability with-
out Christ, and that in the matter of salvation we have no strength,
until new strength is imparted to us through the death of Christ 3
not indeed that we may procure salvation thereby, but that- those
for whom salvation has already been procured in Christ may walk
in the way of salvation, and may do so more and more every day
as that strength shall increase. Thirdly, that death is amplified
from its end—“ for the ungodly’' says the apostle, that is—‘ that
he might deliver us from ungodliness and the death due thereunto.’
Or it may be said, and perhaps more correctly, that this third am-
plification of the death of Christ is taken from the adjunct of the
ungodliness of us for whom he died: the sense of the words will
then be—‘ when Christ died for us we were only ungodly 3’ and
the syllogism of the proof will be as follows :—

‘ The love of God superabounds towards those, or he sheds forth
