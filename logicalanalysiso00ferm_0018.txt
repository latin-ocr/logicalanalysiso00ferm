xii LIFE OF FERME.

After he had acquired a knowledge of grammar and the Latin au-
thors, he was, apparently in the year 1584, being of “good age,''*
transferred to the University, then recently opened under the aus-
pices of the never-to-be-forgotten Robert Rollock. Here he en-
joyed the instructions of that distinguished promoter of learning in
Scotland during the course of four years—the term prescribed by
him as the curriculum of study preparatory to the taking of the
degree of Master of Arts. Under Rollock’s guidance Ferme
studied, in addition to the Greek, the Dialectics of Ramus, (to
which his preceptor attached the greatest value, as an instrument
so admirably adapted to the study of logic, that no one, in his opi-
nion, who was ignorant of it, could either excel in synthetical, or
know anything of analytieal reasoning); the rhetoric of Talaeus,
the pupil and follower of Ramus 3 the Organon‚ Physics and
Ethics of Aristotle3 the treatise De Sphaera Mundi, of John Sa-
crobosco or Holybush3 and a few other works in philosophy.†
From these he was conducted to theology, where, besides the study
of the catechism of Ursinus, he listened to prelections on the
Loci Communes of the Christian system, and to analytical exposi-
tions of some of the Epistles3 he also acquired the rudiments of
the Hebrew tongue. In 1587 Ferme had completed his academi-
cal course, and, along with forty-seven of his erow-students, took
his degree of M. A.; in the Laureation book his name stands se-
cond on the list. In the month of October following his laurea.-
tion, he offered himself as a candidate for the office of Regent,

but on this occasion without success ; his fellow-student Philip
