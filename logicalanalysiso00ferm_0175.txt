EmsTLE OF PAUL To Tun ROMANS. 133

20. “For creation has been made subject to vanity.'’ He here
proves t-he antecedent, viZ.—‘ that created things wait with thrust-
out head, or with intense longing, for the glory-to be revealed—
of the sons of God.’ The arguments by which he proves it are
two: the first is taken from the adjunet of the present condition
of created things3 the second. from the adjunct of the pain and
sorrow or sighs of created things, under their present condition.
As regards the former, namely, the adjunct of the present condi·-
tion of created things, the apostle shews the truth of the antece-
dent from it in this way :—

‘ Creation, or created things have been made subject to vanity,
in hope of deliverance into the glory of the sons of God t

‘Therefore, creation waits with intense longing for the revelae
tion of that glory.'

The antecedent is given in verses 20, 21, where the present con-
dition of created things is shewn, being represented as consisting
in two things : first, ‘that created things have been made subject
to vanity 3' and, secondly, that they have been made subject in the
hope of deliverance? As regards the first, under the name of
vanity, I understand here two things: lst, ‘ man himself? to whom
created things have been made subject, and whom they serve, who,
in Ps. lxii. 10, is called ‘⁴ vanity,” and “vainer than vanity ;'' 2d,
‘ all the misery of created things on man's account,' which again I
consider as comprised in three particulars. Of these the first is,
—‘ the miserable bondage of created things under sinful man ;’ the
misery of which bondage is seen in two things: lst, in their
annoyance and fatigue, which God pities, and against which he
has made provision in the fourth commandment, (Ex. xx· 10);
2d1y, in their perversion to a different end from that for which
they were created, and for which they were designed to be ser·-
vieeable to man, (Hos. ii. 8.) The second particular is, the pollu-
tion of created things from the contagion of man's sin, under which
pollution the creature suffers, and under which it groans, until it
shall be purified by renewal with fire at the coming of the Lord,
(2 Pet. iii. 10.) The third particular of this misery is, the various
