154 LOGICAL ANALYsm or THE

To this objection and offence arising from the opposition of the
JeWS, the apostle replies in these three chapters, ix. x. xi 3 and his
reply consists of two parts: for first of all he admits the antece-
dent of the enthymeme or assumption of the syllogism, viz.—‘ that
the Jews speak against the gospel, and by speaking against it are
the occasion of offence to the Gentiles ς’ secondly, he denies the
consequence of the enthymeme, or hypothetical proposition of the
syllogism, namely,—‘ that on that account, or because of the
offence of which the Jews are the occasion, the way of salvation
which he had announced is not the true way, or that those who
are engrafted in Christ through faith are not free from condemna-
tion.' The first part of the reply, or the granting of the antece-
dent, is given in the first five verses3 after which he prosecutes
the second part, viZ.——‘ that the offence occasioned by the apos-
tate Jews (letrae-ts nothing from his gospel.> The apostle does
not expressly state the first part of his reply, or his confession
concerning the opposition of the Jews, in these first five verses,
but only intimates it by its effect ; which effect of the apostacy of
the Jews who rejected the gospel is the adjunct of the apostle’s
grief, or his great sorrow and continual anguish of mind, as he
himself speaks, on account of that apostacy of his pcople, and. their
rejection of the truth as it is in Christ 3 for in this way he both
convicts them of speaking aga-inst it, and in the meantime avoids
offending those who thus contradicted, by ingratiating himself
with them through a display of his grief on account of their
wickedness. This grief and continual anguish of his he proves

by two arguments.

1. “ Ι say the truth by Christ 3 I lie not.'’ The first argument
of the proof is taken from a twofold testimony. The one is that
of Christ set forth by contraries,—‘ I say the truth3 Ι lie not3
Christ is my witness that I have great sorrow on account of the ’
Jews ε’ this first testimony, therefore, is equivalent to an oath3

’ for to swear is nothing else than to call God to witness that we

speak the truth. “My conscience also bearing me witness?
