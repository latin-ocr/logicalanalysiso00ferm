either to be used or omitted for the purpose of gaining over the
weak to God3

‘ But the former is true—the service of our God does not consist
in these things : ’

‘ Therefore they are to be used or omitted for gaining over
weak brethren to God.’

The assumption is given in the text. “ But righteousness, and
peace, and joy through the Holy Spirit.” He illustrates the as-
sumption by a contrast, consisting of three parts, in which he says
that the spiritual service of God, or that which·is in spirit and in
