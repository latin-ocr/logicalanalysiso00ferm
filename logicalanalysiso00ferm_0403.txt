EPISTLE or PAUL 'ro Tun ROMANS. 361

me :” for if they strove in prayers with him, and he with them, he
strove as a social cause of the same affection with them.

31. “ That Ι may be delivered from those that are disobedient
in Judea.” Three ends of the prayers requested are pointed out
in the two following verses. The first of these is—‘ deliverance
from the disobedient3’ who are described by the subject-place of
their habitation z—they are Jews, dwelling “ in Judea.’' Moreover,
by “disobedient,” Ι understand here, not only—‘ those who per-
sisted in refusing to believe on J esus Christ,' but also—‘ those
-who, professing Christ, were false brethren‚ and through zeal for
the law, corrupters of the gospel of J esus Christ: The apostle,
therefore, requests the Romans to pray for him, first of all, for this

that is—‘ that I may comfort you with the gospel, and may re-
ceive comfort from you in return, via, when I see the grace of the
-gospel effectual in you? From this last end of these prayers we
may see, that this epistle to the Romans was written when he was
-j0urneying to Jerusalem for the last time: for he promises that he ‹,
:will immediately take his journey through them into Spain3 and,
‚moreover, in iver. 23, he has shewn that he had no longer a place
in these regions, as far as the Adriatic sea—on the eastern shore of
