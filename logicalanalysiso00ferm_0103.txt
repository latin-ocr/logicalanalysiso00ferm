EPISTLE ΟΕ PAUL TO THE ROMANS. 61

Abraham. In this twofold respect, Abraham was mado the father
of many nations, viz, by believing, and by laying hold on the
promise through faith3 so that this seed of many nations from
Abraham, is of the nations by believing, and born to him by the
power of God promising. ‘⁶ Who quickeneth the dead, and calleth
the things that are not as though they were.’⁷ We have in these
words a description of that God who made promise to Abraham,
and whom Abraham believed from his effects, by which the power
of his promise is shown, and by which he himself is distinguished
from all the false gods in which the Gentiles had believed. The
effects here mentioned are two : the first is ‘ the quickening of the
dead in sin,’ (Eph. ii. 1.) our regeneration being so called by
synecdoche of the part for the whole, the second is the calling of
the Gentiles, whereby ‘those who were not a people,’ as Hosea
speaks, ‘are called the people of the living God.' The former of
these effects, therefore, is common 3 for all, both Jews and Gentiles,
are “dead in sins,'’ as the apostle shows at large in Eph. ii. The
other is peculiar to the Gentiles, according to the explanation of
the apostle, chap. ix. verses 24, 25, 26, of this epistle3 where,
quoting from the prophet, he compares the calling of the Gentiles
with the first creation of all things: for just as in it God first called
into existence things that were not, and they were3 so God calls
the Gentiles, who previously were not a people, and, by his call—
ing, they become the people of the living God.

18. “Who (viz, Abraham) against hope believed in hope, that
he should become the father of many nations.'' As in the preced-
ing words he has described the God whom Abraham believed, so
in these the apostle describes the faith by which he believed God:
first, from the adjunct of its difficulty—he believed “ against-
, hope ;'’ secondly, fr0m the adjunct of its firmness—he believed “in
’ hope ;'' thirdly, from its material cause—he believed “that he
should become the father of many nations;” and he explains the
several parts of the description in the words that follow: “Ac-
cording to that which had been said (unto him) so shall thy seed
