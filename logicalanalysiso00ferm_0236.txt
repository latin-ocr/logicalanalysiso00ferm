it is not enough for a man to say that he believesffl Christ, if, in'
the mean time, he refuses to confess him, especially when he is
asked to give an account of his faith ε and God calls us to confes-
sion even at the risk of death, and with the loss of everything
which we possess in life3 ‘ for he,' says our Lord, Matt. xvi. 25,
⁴ who wishes to save his life [by changing sides and refusing to pro-
fess Christ,] is unworthy of me, and shall lose his life? For this
reason, therefore, the apostle urges profession along with saith in
the case of all who are to be saved3 as likewise Peter, lst Epist.
iii. 153 since this profession is the ‘⁶ seal³⁹ wherewith we are eealed
to the Lord in the sight of the world, and ‘the name of God writ-
ten on our forehead,’ to be read by all even in the midst of perse-
cutions.

11. “ For the Scripture saith, whosoever believeth on him shall
not be put to shame.'' By adducing the testimony of Scriptura
(Is. xxviii. 16), he proves the reason which he has just concluded,
namely——‘ that confession of the mouth must be combined with
faith in the heart, and that confession with the mouth is unto sal-
vation,’ or ⁶ that the salvation of all those who from faith confess
that J esus is Lord, is certain.’ For two things are signified by the
expression—“ shall not be put to shame:” (1.) the duty of him
who believes 3 (2.) the grace of him who perseveres in that duty.
The duty of him who believes is—‘ to profess his hope withou't
shame, and that J esus Christ, as he is revealed in the Gospel, is
the Lord of his hope 3' “ I am not ashamed,’' says the apostle, o. i.
16, “ of the gospel of Christ :'’ and the grace of him who perse·-
veres in that duty is—‘ that he shall not be put to shame or disap-
pointed by his hope3 for “ hope putteth not to shame,’' c. v. 5.
Consequently he is said. “ not to be put to shame,' who is neither
ashamed of the Lord J esus, nor visited with shame on account of
the hope which he has reposed. in him3 the apostle therefore thus
argues from the prophet 2-
< ‘ Whoever believes on J esus Christ shall not be put to shame,’
i. e. ‘v he will neither be ashamed to profess the Lord, nor shall his
hope put him to shame when he so professes :'
