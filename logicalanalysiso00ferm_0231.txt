EPISTLE or PAUL To THE ROMANS. 189

book of the law '-—-which even the Jews themselves knew, since
they offered sacrifices for sins on that account, (Gal. ii. 15, 16) ε
whence the conclusion—-

‘ Therefore righteousness from the law is impossible and a thing
which cannot be attained.'

6. “But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh thus;'’
Say not in thine heart, who shall ascend into heaven? that is, to
bring down Christ from (on high ;)

7. “ Or, who shall descend into the abyss‘? that is, to bring
'back Christ from the dead.'’

He next proves the second part of the antecedent, or ⁶ the ease
of the righteousness of faith 3 ’ the argument by which it is proved
being in like manner taken from the Mosaic description of that
righteousness. That description consists of a contrast3 the first
member or arsis of which is contained in these ssth and 7 th verses,
and the second in the commencement of verse 8, and what follows
thereafter. In the two verses before us, then, the apostle, by ad-
ducing the testimony of Moses, releases every one who seeks right-
eousness from faith out of a twofold difficulty ε 116 releases him out
of the one when he says—‘ let him not think of asc-ending into
heaven,’ verse 6 : the release out of the other is thus expressed—
‘ there is no need that he should think of descending into the
abyss,' verse 7. Each of these is illustrated by its end: the
former, or the ascent into heaven, by this end——‘ to bring down
Christ? the latter, or the descent intovthe abyss, by this—‘ to
bring back J esus Christ from the dead,' (for as the apostle com·-
ments upon and explains Moses): because, forsooth, if it were
necessary that one should ascend into heaven in order that 116
might be justified by saith, it would be for this end, viz., that 116
might thence bring down J esus Christ, again to assume our flesh,
and in that fiesh to die ε or if he had to descend into the abyss,
he would do so, that he 'might bring Christ back from the dead.
From an this toil, both of ascending and descending, and at the
