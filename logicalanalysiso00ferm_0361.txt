EPls'rLE OF PAUL To THE ROMANS. 319

state, or ‘standing to the Lord' by ‘living to the Lord3' so he
illustrates privation by privation, or ‘falling to the Lord,’ (τό
πίπτειν Κυρίῳ) ‘ by dying to the Lord,’ (τό Κυρίῳ ἀποθνήσκειν.)

8. “For whether we live, we live unto the Lord, or die, we die
unto the Lord.’⁷ This is the assumption itself, amplified by what
equally follows in the case of privative opposites, just as the illus-
tration of it in the previous verse was taken from the contrary.
Moreover, ‘ to live to the Lord,' is-—‘ so to live,' and ‘to die
(ἀποθνῆσκειν) to the Lord,’ is—‘ so to die, as that the Lord may
be glorified, and the honour of his name may be present to our
minds, both in our life, and in our death.’ ‘4 WVhether we live,
therefore, or die, we are the Lord's. This is an inference, or ulte-
rior conclusion, instead of the proper conclusion of the foregoing
syllogism. The proper conclusion of the foregoing syllogism is—
‘ therefore, he who eats or does not eat, he who esteems the day or
esteems it not, whatever he does or omits, in living, does it to the
Lord.' From this the apostle infers, as an ulterior conclusion——
‘that in life, and in death, we are the Lord's,' that is, ‘to be
judged by him alone, and not by one another, nor by ourselves 3’
because, as no man lives either to himself or to another, or dies
either to himself or to another, so no man is either his own or
another’s, but the Lord's alone: for we are his to whom we live,
to whom we die, and whom we serve, and to be judged in our life,

death, and service, by him only ; as the apostle teaches us in lst*
Cor. iv. 3, 4.

5. “ For Christ both died and rose again, and revived for this
end.'' The apostle goes on to prove the preceding inference, viz„
-‘·that whether falling or standing, living or dying, we are the
Lord’s,' by a new argument, taken from the end of the death, re-
surrection, and subsequent eternal life of J esus Christ :—

‘ Christ both died, and after death rose again, and since his re-

surrection lives for ever, for the end, that he might be Lord at
once of the dead, and of the living:
