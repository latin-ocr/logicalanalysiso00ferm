 

ERRATA.

N.B.—The first twelve chapters of Fermc's commentary having been
printed, without being submitted to the Translator for correction while
passing through the prem, he regrets to find that several verbal inaccu-
racies, and numerous mistakes in the punctuation, division of sentences,
and marks of quotation, have escaped notice.—The errors of the latter
description particularly affect the syllogisms and enthymemes; which,
being stated in due form by the author, should have been uniformly
divided and pointed in the regular way, as·has been done in the last
four Chapters. Had this been attended to, as was the intention of the
Translator, it would both have been more in keeping with the character
of the treatise itself, and, at least, have somewhat lightened the labour of
the reader.

Of these, those only which materz'ally affect the sense are noticed be-
low, along with such verbal errors as have been detected‚ after a careful
revision.
