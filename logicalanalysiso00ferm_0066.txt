24 LocchL ANALYffls OF THE

Therefore the judgment of God is just.

The assumption is contained in the text, and is doubly enuncia-
ted. First, by an abridged comparison, which is indicated by the
expression, ‘⁶ According to''—“ God will render to every man ac-
cordiny to his deeds.''

7. “ To them who by patient continuance in well-doing.'' Se-
condly, by an extended comparison, in which there is a distribu-
tion, both of the deeds, and of their consequences3 the latter are
divided into rewards and punishments, and its own appropriate
consequence is annexed to every man’s deed. The deeds are
either good or evil. The good deeds are defined by their end and

is a sin of omission—“ they do vnot obey the truth,’' that is, as he
said before, '“ knowing God, they yet glorify him not as God.”
“ But obey unrighteousness'’—the second effect of their conten-
tions and disputings, which is arsin of commission, the commission,
namely, of “ all unrighteousness,’' with which he formerly said
that the Gentiles were “filledy and which he traced to their ¹re-

fusing to obey the truth, chap. i. 28, 29. To these will be rendered 4

“ indignation and wrath‚” the equal and appropriate punishment '
which, by the judgment of God, is rendered to evil deeds. The
apostle therefore explains his abridged comparison—“ God vyill
render to every man according to his deeds”——in this way :—-‘ God‘
