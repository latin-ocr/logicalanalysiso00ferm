EPISTLE OF PAUL To THE ROMANS: 281

tain that your peace in this life is disturbed,' for he has before
said that there are some who persecute and do evil to the sons of
the Church3 ‘however,' says the apostle, ‘ let not an occasion of
disturbing your peace proceed from yourselveS, but, as much as
lieth in you, cultivate peace even with the wicked? The second
restriction of the injunction is expressed in these words, when the
apostle says—‘⁴ if it be possible ;’' by which he would intimate
vthat it is impossible but that an occasion for disturbing our peace
may proceed from ourselves3 for we who believe on Christ must
retain, along with faith, the confession of the mouth 3 and a wicked
world will endure neither the one, nor the other, with peace. The
apostle therefore enjoins upon the Christian not to disturb his own
peace for the sake of the things of this world3 at the same time
admonishing him, if troubled by a wicked world on account of his
religion, not to abandon either his saith or profession for the sake
of the peace of the world: because, although the occasion must
often unavoidably proceed from himself 3 yet the cause is to be
found in the wicked who persecute the faith. From this the
'apostle gives us to learn the following things: First—that it is
impossible, in this world of wicked men, but that an occasion of
disturbing the peace of the Church may proceed from the Church
herself and her sons: for if the Church could have avoided a-ll
occasion for the disturbance of her peace, the apostle would have
said-—‘ be at peace with all,' and would not have added—“ if it be
possible ;” but, by adding this condition—“ if it be possible,’' he
⁴would intimate, that it is impossible that the Church or any of her
sons, continuing to belong to God, should be at peace with the world.
Thus Noah must either have contended with the world, or ceased
to persevere in the hope of being saved when the waters should
overWhelm the wicked ς’ so Moses must either have offended God
-or Pharaoh; and so it was necessary for Abimelech, either to have
refused to do his duty to David, or to afford an occasion to Saul
for the slaughter, both of himself, and his family. >This last exam-
·ple merits our attention, in order that we who are saints may be
able to distinguish between the cause, and the occasion, of the dis-
