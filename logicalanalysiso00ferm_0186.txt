144 LOGICAL ANALYsls OF THE

⁴ But God calls in time, all whom he predestinated before time;

⁶ Therefore he glorifies all whom he predestinated ς’

Which is the proposition of the preceding syllogism. The
assumption of this last syllogism is given by the apostle in the
beginning of verse 303 the proposition, viz„ ‘that God glorifies
those who are called,’ remains as the point to be settled: this the

apostle proves from the immediate effect of the callino· which is

07
the second benefit of God in time, namely, ‘ our justification 3’ and
he does so in this way :—

‘ God glorifies all whom he justifies3

‘ But he justifies all whom he calls:

‘ Therefore he also glorifies all whom he calls 3’

Which was the proposition of the syllogism immediately pre-
ceding. Each of the premises of this last syllogismis given by
the Apostle in the remainder of the 30th v. 3 but, by hysterosis,
the assumption is placed first, in the middle of the verse—⁴ he jus-
tifies those whom he calls 3' and the proposition, consisting of im·-
mediate terms,* for righteousness is the proximate and imme-
diate cause of our glorification with Christ—follows, at the close
of the verse. Wherefore, since the first proposition—⁴ All things
turn out for good to those whom God glorifies'——is immediate,† as
has been already shewn‚ and the proof of the first assumption-.-
‘ God glorifies those whom he foreknevW—has been reduced to the

proximate and immediate cause, the conclusion—‘ all things turn

out for good to those whom God foreknew, and has called accord· Α

ing to His purpose—which was the antecedent of the enthymeme‚
follows from premises which are both immediate. We see, there-
fore, that ‘ foreknowledge,‡ and ‘predestination’ which are eternal
benefits of God, and antecedent to time, are united by an indisso·-
luble connection, as the apostle here testifies, with ‘ calling' which
is a benefit in time3 just as ‘ calling’ itself is united by an indis-

* Terms between which there is no middle term3 or which do not require to be
compared, by means of a syllogism, with any third term.

† i. e. A proposition whose terms are immediate. (See ³¹⁶.)
