(1.) ⁴ The revolt of the Gentiles’—the Gentiles did not obey God;”
(2.) ‘ The issue of their revolt? As regards the former, namely,
‘ the apostacy of the Gentiles‚' it is illustrated by the adjunct of
the time—‘ formerly, that is, ‘from the building of the tower of
Babel even to the incarnation (ἐνσάξκωσιν) of the Son of G0d.'
‘⁴ But now have obtained mercy.’' This is the second thing in-
cluded in the protasis, viz. ‘ the issue of the Gentiles’ apostacy'-
‘ the Gentiles, after apostacy for a definite time, have obtained

obtaining of mercy ς’ which is illustrated by the adjunct of its occa·
sion-A the Israelites, having been recalled, shall obtain merey
through the mercy of the Gentiles themselves! By the “merny
of the Gentiles,'' moreover, I understand, ‘ that which, now that
the gospel has come, they have obtained through occasion of the
hardening of the Israelites,’ that is ζ the grae-e which they have
received to believe the gospel when p'reached, and to embrace
J esus Christ offered in that preaching for righteousness and life ς’
of which grace we see an instance at Antioch (Acts xiii. 48, 49),
where, while the Jews arefoontradioting and fuming with indigna-
