EPISTLE OF PAUL To Tm: ssoMANs. 55

6. “ Even as David also declareth that man blessed unto whom
God imputeth righteousness without works.” The second argu-
ment for the proposition is from the effect of justification before
God, which is happiness 01· blessedness ε

‘ Whosoever is blessed, the same is also righteous before God,
and by whatever means he attains blessedness, by the same means
he attains righteousness3

‘ But he to whom God imputes righteousness is blessed by saith
without works ε

‘ Therefore he to whom God imputes righteousness is righteous
by saith without works.'

The assumption which is contained in this verse is established
by the testimony of David, which is more fully presented out of
Ι Ps. xxxii. in the two following verses.

9. “ Does this declaration of blessedness then apply to the cir-
cumcision only, or to the uncircumcision also? for we say that
saith was imputed to Abraham for righteousness.’' This is the
third subdivision of the first section of the chapter, and. the ampli-
fication of the first assumption, from the adjunct of a twofold time:
‘ Abraham was justified by saith, or faith was imputed to him for
righteousness, first of all in uncircumcision3 and this justificat-ion
of faith was subsequently confirmed, being ratified by the sign of
circumcision. This amplification the apostle manages by anacoe-
nosis 3 * for first of all a question is proposed in the begin-
ning of the verse, and then at the close of the same verse
he states the ground of the question, viz„ the assumption which
has just been concluded: as if he had said :—‘ since we have al-
ready concluded. that faith was imputed to Abraham for righteous-
ness, or that Abraham was justified *and rendered blessed by saith,
the question arises—‘ when was that imputation made, was it after
he was circumcised, or while he was still in uncircumcisio‘n? ’

10. “ How was it then imputed? When he was in circumci-

* i. e. by consulting with his hearers or readers.
