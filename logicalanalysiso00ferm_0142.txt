100 LoeioAL ANALYSIS or THE

‘the law of God does not work, or is not the cause of any sin3
but that which causes and works every sin which arises in men is
the first sin or original sin 3’ in other words, ‘ every sin flows from
original sin, and that by occasion of the law? How original sin
produces Subsequent sins by occasion of the law, has been before
explained under the 20th verse of chap. v., and is explained more
at large by the apostle in what immediately follows.

9. “For without the law sin (indeed) was dead. Moreover, I
was alive without the law: but when the commandment came, sin
(likewise) revived, and I died ;

10. “ And the commandment which (was ordained) for life, was
found to be for death unto me.” In these verses, and the 11th‚ the
apostle proves the latter member of the contrast, viz.——‘ that sin,
or every sort of lust, is produced in us, by sin, through occasion of
the law of Godz’ for the first member of the foregoing contrast
denied the fact—⁶ that the law produced sin 3’ but the sec-ond
affirmed the manner of the fact, vi2.—‘ that original sin wrought
every sort of sin in us, by taking occasion from the law? The
apostle proves that the manner is such* as he has affirmed, or ‘ that
sin is produced by sin through occasion of the law,’ by an argu-
ment drawn from the similar manner of another effect of the same
cause :—— .

‘ Original sin works death to me, or slays me, through the com-
mandment, or through occasion of the law ε

‘ Therefore original sin works in me every sort of sin through
occasion of the law.’ “

The truth of the consequence rests upon this axiom :—that of
two necessary effects which are similarly produced, in whatever
manner the one is produced, the other is produced in the same
manner. ‘ But every subsequent sin is the necessary effect of f
original sin, and death is the necessary effect of both3 also the„ “
dependence of these two effecte upon their causes is similar-z hence
the apost-le thus argues here 2—-
