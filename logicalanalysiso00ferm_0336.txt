rior powers? As for what 116 says, therefore, in the latter part of
the verse—that the magistrates are “ attending upon this very
thing,'’ by “ this very thing'' he means-‘ the duty which it de-
volves upon magistrates to perform, according to the word of
God, and in a good conscience ς’ and that is—‘ to take care of the
state, and to preside over and enjoin upon his subjeots, religiously
and in the Lord.'

7. “ Render therefore to all what ye owe.'’ We come now to
the second sec-tion of the chapter, which, like the first, contains
only one injunction concerning the common duty to be performed
-by Christiane to all who live with them in the state. The injunc-
tion is this—⁴ render to all and to every one what you owe? All
who live along with us in the state are either equal to us, or un·-

low-citizens, you are bound to perform to all others who are fellow-
citizens with you in the state, and to each according to his rank
and degree, this duty—to owe no man any thing? This duty, the
apostle both proves—via, that it is incumbent upon Christiane*-
and illustrates. The proof is briefly comprised in the illative par-
ticle (οῧν) “therefore ;’' the illustration is subjoined, and the apostle
prosecutes it more at length. ‘⁴ Therefore” (οὖν) : this illative
particle shews that ethis second injunction of the chapter, which
refers to the common duty of Christiane, is deduced from the foros

going. discussion, or from the relative duty, and particular injunc-
