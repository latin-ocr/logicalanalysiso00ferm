1312 LOGICAL ANALYSIS or THE

glorious inheritance, our right to which has been established in
Christ J esus:

‘ Therefore as ‘⁴ J esus Christ, the author and finisher of (our)
saith, for the joy that was set before him, endured the cross, de-
spising the shame,'’ (Heb. xii. 2,) so should we most gladly suffer

anything with him, that we may be also glorified along with him,
and in him become heirs of God.

19. “ For the creation watching as it were with thrust-out head
waiteth for the revelation of the sons of God.'' He proceeds to
prove the antecedent of each of the foregoing enthymemes, and to
shew that the excellence of the glory to be revealed is greater
beyond all comparison than our sufferings. This he does by three
arguments, or by a threefold testimony : the first is the common
testimony of created things, or of creation, contained in this and
the following verses, as far as verse 233 the second is that of men
having the first-fruits of the Spirit, in the 23d and subsequent
verses, as far as verse 26 ; the third is that of the Holy Spirit in
verses 26, 27 : so that all these three—creation (ἦ κτίσις), the re-
newed man, and the Holy Spirit through whom he is renewed—
are adduced as witnesses to the excellence of the glory of the sons
of God, and that it exceeds, beyond all comparison, all our suffer-

ings with Christ here, in hope of hereafter enjoying it in the life χ

of bliss. The testimonies of each of these witnesses are shewn,
one by one, from the effects of the witnesses themselves. And,
first, the common testimony of creation or created things is shewn
from their effect, which is illustrated by the adjunct of the mode
of effecting: ‘creation waits for the glory to be revealed’—this is
the effeet3 and it waits for it ‘ with thrust-out head,' or ‘ with in-
tense longing'—this is the mode of effecting. The apostle there-
fore reasons thus :—

‘ Creation waits with intense longing for the revelation of the
glory of the sons of God:

⁴ Therefore, according to the testimony of creation‚ the glory—
to be revealed—of the sons of God is beyond measure excellent!
