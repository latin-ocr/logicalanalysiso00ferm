58 LOGICAL ANALYsls or THE

cedent, viZ.———‘ that the law worketh wrath,' from another and prior
effect of the law :——‘ The law worketh transgression3 Therefore
it worketh wrath also? The proof of the last antecedent is given
in the text :—‘ Where there is no law, there is no transgression:

‘ Therefore the law worketh transgression?

It must be observed, however, that both the effects here ascribed
to the law, viZ.——the transgression of the law, and the wrath of
God ensuing thereupon, are accidental effects, and owing to the
inability* of our flesh: for if we kept the law, the law would work
neither wrath nor transgression3 but since the law has been made,

and we cannot keep it, it can work nothing else than wrath and
transgression.

16. “ Thercfore the inheritance is from faith.'' Here commences
the second section of the chap., containing the conclusion of the
leading syllogismt—‘ Therefore we attain the inheritance of the
heavenly kingdom, and consequently are justified—for the inheri—
tance presupposes righteousness-——from saith, and not from the
works of the law! ‘⁴ That it may be through grace.'’ He illus-
trates the conclusion, viz. ⁴ that our inheritance is from‘faith,’ by
its twofold end. Of these the first is that our inheritance may be
gratuitous, or freely bestowed, which would not be the case if the
inheritance were from the works of the lawz for whatever any one
attains from the works of the law, as the apostle has already said,
he receives from debt, and consequently it is not gratuitous or
freely bestowed 3 work and grace, or grace and debt being diame-
trically opposed to each other, as the apostle afterwards shews,
xi. 6. Here let us observe, in passing, that the design of God
from the beginning was to gain glory to himself from grace, or from
the gratuitous salvation of men, and the free bestowal of the inhe-
ritance, for which end the apostle here says, the inheritance comes
>to men by faith3 so that the sense of the words is :—‘ Our righte- '
vousness andlife is through faith, for the accomplishment of the
design of God from eternity, which was that we should be justified
