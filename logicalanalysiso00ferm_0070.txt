28 LoochL ANALYS1s OF THE

16. “ In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men.’'
This destruction of J ewish and Gentile sinners alike‚ he illus-
trates by the adjunct of the time, which is described by its sub-
ject: it is—“ the day on which God shall judge.⁷’ This judgment
of God is amplified, first by its subject, set forth by an implied
comparison of majority—‘ God will judge, not merely the open,
but the secret sins of men? “According to my gospel.'' Secondly,
this judgment of God is illustrated by its efficient causes: both
the principal, which is J esus Christ3 and the instrumental, which
is the gospel that Paul preached.

And here it is to be observed, that, although he has said that
sinners will perish, either by the law of nature, if they have sinned
without the law, or by the written law, if they have sinned under
the law3 yet he says that that just judgment of God will be ac-
cording to the gospel 3 because, of a truth, thc Lord is just, and his
judgtnent is just, in both condemning and acquitting by the gospel
alone. For by the law it will be impossible for any one to be
justly acquitted, whether it be the written law or the law of na-
ture, as the apostle is afterwards about to sh0w3 whereas by the
gospel, both the condemnation of unbelievers and* the acquittal of
believers will be just ε since, in addition to the other sins of which
the former are convicted by the law, they have despised the grace
of the gospel3 and because the latter possess, through the gospel,
the righteousness of Christ, which is all-sufficient for their acquit-
tal. With regard, therefore, to what the apostle has said in verses
7 and 10‚—‘ that eternal life, glory, honour and peace will be
given to him that worketh good,’—he does not thereby intimate
that it is possible for any one to be justified by the law on the
ground of his own works3 but by shewing, both to Jews and
Gentiles, that the sole condition ofjustification by the law is, that
they keep it perfectly, and work well inall things,—a condition
which both must be conscious was not theirs,——-he wishes to urge
them to betake themselves to Christ, that they may be justified
from the gospel.
