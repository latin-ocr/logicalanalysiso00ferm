not hinder the apostacy, which, although begun by their kings,
they bot-h could and ought to have hindered. Such resistance,
however, to ungodly superiors who trample upon religion, should
not be offered by every one, nor by any private individual, but
⁴,only by the estat-es of the realm and its higher members, either all,
or at least some of them: the private Israelites, therefore, acted
rightly, who, when the whole kingdom complied with their ungodly
«king in his apost-acy, did not resist the king and kingdom, but
,passed over into the kingdom of Judah (2 Chron. xi. 16), there to
worship *Jehovah with a good conscience, according to his own
law. As, therefore, private individuals are not permitted to resist
the magistrate, even when he enjoins what is ungodly, but rather
to withdraw, and go to a place where they can serve God with a
good conscience 3 so neither are the estates of the realm and
higher members of the kingdom to be condemned, if at any time
they have resisted their superior, seeking to make havock of the
Church and true worship of God, providing that the arms of that
resistance shall have been defensive in opposition to tyranny, not
offensive and aimed at a superior. Such, of late years, were the
arms of the estates of France, whereby they defended themselves
against the king forcing Popery upon them, and persecuting them
on account of the pure worship of God. Therefore, although those
'who resist in this manner, for conscience sake, are wont to be called
-‘ rebels,’ and to be proscribed as such by the tyrants who perse-
cute them on account of the worship of God, yet are they neither
rebels, nor enemies, but by far the best of subjects, even in relation
‘to the tyrants themselves who persecute them; as clearly appears
from the difference between those who thus resist tyrants, and those
who are enemies to, or rebels against the power, when compared to-
gether: for rebels and enemies will not lay down their arms at the
desire of the power, even when making just concessions3 while
those of whom we are speaking would have yielded a most ready
obedience to their superiors, had they only granted them permis-
sion to serve J ehovah. v
