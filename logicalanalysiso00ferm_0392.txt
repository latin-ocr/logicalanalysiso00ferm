350 LOGICAL ANALYsls OF THE

ject of which; to which; and in which. The subject of which, is—
‘ J esus Christ :’ grace has been given to Paul that he might be-—“ a
minister of J esus Christ.’' The subject to which, is—‘ the Gentiles :’
Paul is —“ a minister of J esus Christ to the Gentiles.'’ The subject
in which, is—-‘ the gospel τ’ Paul is—‘ a minister of J esus Christ in
the gospel‚’ or “ officiating in the gospel.'’ The particular end is—-
