EPISTLE OF PAUL TO Tun ROMANS. 293

'Jects in reference to their duty, whereby, according to the 5th com-
mandment of the law, they are bound to subject themselves, and
that lovingly, to the superior powers, because of the injunction of
J ehovah 3’ so that this conscience is not given by, nor based upon
human laws, but upon a divine command. From this it follows,
that subjects are no farther bound to obey the magistrate because
of conscience, than in as far as he himself presides and enjoins with
a good conscience, and on the authority of the word of God: and
besides, it is worthy of observation, that the wrath of the magis-
trate, unless directed against the disobedient, refusing to do their
duty according to the injunction of Jehovah, is neither just, nor
lawful, nor to be feared by his subjeets, but Christians, in the Chris-
tian warfare, must pass through the midst of it to victory in Christ,
-by the power of the Spin-it of God3 as we see in the case of Daniel,
who rose to victory through the lions' den, with his three friends,
-who esteemed the wrath of the king as nothing in comparison
with their duty to God‚ although the disobedient were threatened
with a fiery furnace, the heat of which had been increased seven
times.

6. “ On this account also ye pay tribute.’' This is the fourth
and last argument by which the apostle establishes—-‘ that Chris-

‘their effect—‘ they pay tribute, and that on account of labour and
*ministry 3’ for the argument runs thus :—

‘ To whom you pay tribute for ministry and promoting a com*-
‘mon work, -to him you should be subject in the doing of that work 3 >

‘ But you pay tribute to the magistrate for carrying on the com-
-mon work of governing the state in the Lord: ’
«- ⁶ Therefore you should willingly and lovingly subject yourselves
to him in the doing of that work?
¹ The assumption only is given in the text ; and as both it, and
. the proposition to which it is subjoined, are self·evident, the
apostle, withoutss any further prooss leaves it tor theniselves to con-
clude ‘ that they-should· subject· themselves, in the Leni, to the supe:
