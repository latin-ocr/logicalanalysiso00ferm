 

LIFE OF FERME. xvii

Highlands‚ the name of which has not been ascertaincd.* Here
he suffered the greatest severities, which he seems to have borne
with much fortitude. “ I have to this hour,’' he wrote to ΜΓ
Robert Bruce in 1608, “ been relieved by the comfort of no crea-
ture 3 neither have I here to whom Ι may go. A thousand deaths
hath my soul tasted of 3 but still the mercy and truth of the Lord
hath recovered me. The Lord perfytc [accomplish] his own work
in me.” †

How long Ferme continued the victim of this eruel injustice is
uncertain. In 1609 he was still in confinement3 and, as Calder-
wood terms it, “put to his shifts.''‡ Archibald Simeon in his [un-
published] Annales Ecclesiae Scotorum says, that Ferme was con-
fined “ fere triennio.'' As he was sent to the Highlands in Octo-
ber 1606, if he was liberated in the fall of 1609, his banishment
would be exaotly for about three years. How far Simson is cor-
rect in this statement, however, may be doubted3 all we know for
certain is, that Ferme was restored, and continued at F raserburgh
till his death. ξ

Notwithstanding the interruptions and. harassment to which he
was thus exposed, he discharged the functione of his office with
credit in his new sphere. “With what zeal he taught at Fraser-

burgh,'' says Adamson, “both publicly and privately, from house

‘¹' Calderwood simply mentions (vol. vi., p. 590), that the ministers “who were wairded
in Stirline, Doune, Dunbartane‚ were to be confynned in barbarous parts, as the
Eewes, the IleQ‘KintyrQ Ireland, Oathnesse.'' Further on (p. 702) he mentions that
Mr Ferme ‘⁴ was confynned. in the Hielands.” ’
