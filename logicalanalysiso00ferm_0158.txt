116 LoeicAL ANALYSIS OF THE

and the beginning of verse 4, ‘that there is no condemnation to
those who are in Christ J esus ς’ and then, in the end of verse 4,
and the following verses, as far as verse 9, ⁴ that that freedom
from condemnation belongs to those who are not hypocritically,
but really in Christ 3' that is, “ who walk not after the flesh but
after the Spirit.” The argument for the first branch, or that
whereby is proved the certainty of the salvation of those who are
really in Christ J esus, is drawn from the effect of the gospel, and
of its spiritual ministration, that is, of the gospel rendered effec-
tual through the internal operation of the Holy Spirit3 for so I
understand the expression, “the law of the Spirit of life,’' here, as
opposed to ‘⁴ the letter” of ‘⁴ death,'' or ‘⁶ the ministration of
condemnation,” 2 Cor. iii. 6, 7. For as condemnation, or death,
which is the effect of the letter which “killetl1‚” and deliverance,
or the certainty of salvation,——which is the effect of the law of
the Spirit, or of the gospel,—are contrary to each other, so,
the argument being from opposites, the syllogism runs thus :—

‘There is no condemnation to those who have been delivered
by the law of the Spirit of life from the law of sin and of death.

‘But the law of the Spirit of life has delivered me, says the
apostle,' and all who with me are in J esus Christ, from the law of
sin and of death:

‘Therefore there is no condemnation, either to me, or to any
who are in J esus Christ? Δ

The assumption is given in the text3 for the understanding of
which, besides what we have just said concerning the law of the
Spirit, three things are necessary to be known. First, then, you
must know that by the Spirit here is meant the Holy spirit,
whom the apostle describes in these words by his effect, and
subject. He is denominated the Spirit of life, because he not only
is life, but works life in us, especially the life of God and spiritual
or inward life3 therefore he is denominated “ the Spirit of life’'
stom his effect. Then it is added “ in Christ Jesus⁴;'’ both
because he is “ the Spirit of the Son,'’ and because he is 'given to' Ι
us in Christ the Son of God, (Gal. iv. 6.) These words are added,
