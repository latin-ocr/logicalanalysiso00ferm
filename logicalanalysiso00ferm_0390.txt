348 LOGICAL ANALYSIS or THE

brethren ε’ for those who are ‘ brethren’ must necessarily be con-
nected together in a partnership of various kinds3 for they are the
children of the same parent, they belong to the same house and
family, and have a share in the goods of the common family : these,
therefore, should least of all be offended with each other. The
second thing whereby he guards against the offence which the
Romans might take, is the establishment of his authority3 to
which he approaches by a sort of pious invalidating of that autho-
rity, and the assigning of a reason. Foris the Romans should
be disposed to charge him with boldness in writing more boldly
to them, with a view to prevent their being offended by this
boldness, or freedom of his in writing‚ he first of all confesses
concerning himself—‘ that he has written more boldly to them
in part :⁹ he then assigns a reason for this freedom of his, which
they might perhaps call—⁴ boldness,’ but which he confesses to
be—‘ boldness in part 3’ both that they may see that it is not

freely to profess it to thern in future. “ I have written more boldly
to you, brethren.’' This is the common proposition, both of the
profession whereby he professes his partnership with them, and of
the confession whereby he confesses that he is guilty. “In part-'⁹

boldness, and shows that there is nothing wrong in it, although
confessed ε for ί( to have written more boldly in part,” is—‘ to have
written freely to them in Christ‚' although as yet unknown to him ς
and that because of his persuasion concerning them, that they were

that is—‘ that they were such as he could write *to in Christ? ‘ If,-
therefore, any of them should be obstinately bent on charging the
apostle with boldness in writing, he most effectually convicte such,
by this epanorthosis, as well as by his own judgment concerning
them, of being destitute of the grace of J esus Christ: for hitherto·
he confesses the charge of boldness, only in so far as he has written
freely, notstom knowledge—since he has not yet seen thema-*but
