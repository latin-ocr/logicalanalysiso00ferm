Er1s‘rLE OF PAUL To THE ROMANs. 339

is contained the transition, whereby the apostle passes from the
foregoing particular conclusion to the common conclusion of his
whole discussion, thus far, in this epistle ; so that the meaning of
the words is :-‘ what I say in the conclusion just given, and in the
whole preceding discussion, from the commencement, is this—that
J esus Christ is a minister, and that of God 3’ whence, in Isaiah xlii.
1, God says of Christ,—“ behold my servant.’' The general con-
clusion, therefore, of the whole discussion, thus far, is this—‘ that
J esus Christ, and he alone, is the minister of God to our salvation τ’
so the apostle has commenced the whole discussion—‘ the gospel
of J esus Christ is the power of God unto salvation to those who
believe ;’ and so he now concludes it—‘ J esus Christ, announced
in the gospel, is the minister of God unto salvation to those who
believe, that we may be ministers unto salvation to one another?
‘⁴ *Of the circumcision.'’ J esus Christ never circumcised any man
ministerially, nor was he ever minister of any sacrament, except
the sacrament of the Lord's Supper, of which, as of all the sacra-
ments, he is the author, and of which, as his proper function, he is
the minister: when he is here called—“ the minister of the circum-‘
cision,'' therefore, it is by metonymy of the adjunct for the subject3
so that the meaning is-—‘ he was the minister of God to the cir-
cumcised,' that is, ‘ to the legal church, or the people of God un-
der the law? For if any one prefers to say, that there is here a
synecdoche, and that the part is put for the whole, viz„ ‘⁴ circum-
cision,'’ a part of the legal service, for ‘ the whole service of the law,’
I do not see how that can be correctly asserted ; since J esus Christ
= came, not to give the law, but to announce the gospel, as he him*
sels says, Isaiah lxi. 1. It is true that he came to keep the law,
and to keep it fully, as he himself teaches us, Matt. v. 17 ; but not
to be 3 minister of the law, but the minister of God, unto salvation,
of the people of the law: J esus Christ, therefore, came to be the
'minister of God unto salvation of as many of the circumcised as
should believe3 as Paul has spoken at the outset. Accordingly,
in this and the following verses, as far as verse 13, he amplifice this
‘ ministry’ of J esus Christ, whereby he is ‘ the ministerus God
