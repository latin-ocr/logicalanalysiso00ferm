EPISTLE OF PAUL To THE Romus. 141

by way of assumption, ‘ is conformable to the will of God (κατὰ
Θεὸν);

‘ Therefore, although made only with sighs, and these unutter-

apostle encourages those who are joint heirs with Christ to suffer

by its cause and foundation, which is ‘ the purpose of God? The
purpose (πρόθεσιν) of Grod I here take to be identical with that
which the same apostle in Ephes. i. 2, denominates,—-“ the bene-
