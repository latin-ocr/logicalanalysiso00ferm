146 LOGICAL ANALYSIS or THE

arguments are deduces] in support of this general conclusion, viz„
that no adversary shall prevail over the saints: the first is that
which occurs so often in the Psalms, drawn from the adjunct of
the presence of Godz——‘ God is for all of us who are in Christ
J esus:

‘ Therefore no one who is against us,' or ζ no adversary shall
prevail over us?

32. “ He who spared not his own son, but delivered him up for
us all.⁷' This is the second argument for the general conclusion,
taken from the act of God in delivering up his son to death for
us3 from which, as the greater, the apostle here reasons, and con-
cludes—that all other things as the less shall be bestowed on us by
Gocl in his son J esus Christ. The reasoning is to this effect :—-
⁶ God delivered up his son for us: Therefore with him he will
not only grant us defence against our foes, but will give us all
things in the son, who was delivered up for us? The antecedent,
which is given in the beginning of this 32d verse, is illustrated by ’
a contrastz——‘ He spared not his son, but delivered him up to
death for us 3' and by the adjunct of the son, who was delivered
up—‘ he was God’s own Son‚' that is, ‘ by birth, and only begot-
ten‚' not his adopted or factitious son, like us who are in Christ
J esus. “ How shall he not alsolwith him freely bestow upon us
all things ?’' The consequent of the enthymeme is amplified by a
twofold comparison of majority, and by the adjunct of the manner.
The first comparison of majority is——‘ He who delivered up his
son for us, will much more grant us in his son defence against our
foes ;’ the second comparison is—-That he who gave his son will not
only grant us defence against our foes, but over and above that,
will give us all things in his son; the adjunct of the manner of
giving is —‘ that he will give freely,' or ‘ that what he gives us he
will bestow upon us freely in his son? ’
