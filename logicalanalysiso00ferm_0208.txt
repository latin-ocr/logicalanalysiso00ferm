166 LOG-ICAL ANALYsffl OF THE

Rebecca, the children being not yet born, and having done nothing
either good or bad? This amplification is contained in the first
part of verse 11. In the remainder of the verse a reason for the
adjunct of the time is given, under the form of a contrast, from its
end, which is, ‘that the purpose of God, according to> election,
might abide firm, not from the works of the children themselves,
—for, as yet, they had done none,—but from God that calls ς’ that

in the present instance, is suggested by the proof of the last ex-
ample, in which it has been said, ‘ that God neither confers grace,

nor reject-s ‘⁶ from works,'' but that grace is from ‘⁶ the purpose of -

God,” according to his own election and calling, and altogether
independent of works3 so that grace makes a distinction between* ⁸
Jacob and Esau, who are by nature equal, and equally undeserving,
