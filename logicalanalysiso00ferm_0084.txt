42 LOGICAL ANALYSIS OF THE

manifest without the law, yet proved by the testimony both of the
law, and of the prophets 3———‘ that righteousness,’ says the apostle,
‘is God’s righteousness through faith of Jesus Christ, unt-o all,
and upon all those who believe on him? In this definition, there
is first the genus :—‘ that righteousness of which Ι speak is really
righteousness.’ This he asserts against the sensual of his day,
who thought (as do the Papists of our own day after them,) that
all righteousness which is not from the law and our own works, is
imaginary 3 in opposition to which the apostle says, that this righte-
ousness which is without the law is really righteousness: this is
the genus. Secondly, the characteristic or specific difference—
whereby that righteousness which is without the law is shewn to
be more excellent than that which is from the law, if any such
there could be—is drawn from the principal efficient cause, the
subject, and the instrumental efficient cause. The principal effi-
cient cause of this righteousness of God, or righteousness by which
we are righteous before God, is—“God;” wherefore the apostle
calls it God’s righteousness: and God effects it, lst, by giving it,
John iii. 163 2d, by imputing it, Rom. iv. 53 3d, by accepting it
when imputed, Matt. xvii. 5. The subject of it is twofold. The
primary, or subject in which the righteousness alluded to primarily
resides, and that, by keeping the law fully, is—“Jesus Christ ;’'
for he alone has procured by his obedience that righteousness
whereby we are righteous before God: the secondary is—“all
who believe,” who become righteous by the imputation of his
righteousness 3 and, accordingly, the apostle calls this righteous-
ness ours, through J esus Christ, thereby intimating, that the ori-
ginal possessor of this righteousness is J esus Christ, and then, we
through him. The primary subject then of this righteousness is
Christ, who has it by his own keeping of the law ; and after him
believers‚ who have it by God's imputation, from him. This se-
condary subject the apostle expresses by the universal term “ all,'’
and that twice repeated, in order to set aside the distinction be—
tween Jews and Gentiles, as the words immediately following
shew, and prove that the Gentiles were called to a participation in
