EPISTLE or PAUL To Tm: noMANs. 253

brethren, that is, all who were sharers and partakers with himself
in the righteousness of faith and life through J esus Christ, accord-
ing to the gospel, from conformity (συσχηματισμόν) with the pre-
sent age. By “ the present age '’ (τᾶν ἀιῶνα τοῦτον) here, Ι un-
derstand, by metonymy of the adjunct for the subject—‘ the men
of this age,’ those, namely, whom the apostle, in 1 Cor. ii. 14, calls
“ sensual,'’ that is, ‘having no endowments except those of nature,
corrupt as that now is, and entirely destitute of regeneration,* or
the new birth through the spirit ε’ for so J ude, in the 19th verse
of his epistle, defines the ‘⁶ sensual '' man (ψυχικόν) as—‘ the man
who has not the Spirit (of Christ,') (τᾶν τό πνεῦμα μὴ ἔχοντα)

prohibition, along wit-h the grounds of the same, see 2 Cor. vi. 14,
15, 16. “ But transform yourselves by the renewal of your mind.’'
This is the second member of the contrast, whereby he recom-
mends to his brethren to endeavour to grow in the Spirit, or the
renewal of the mind, (which growth in the renewal of the mind, is
the growth of vthe inward man 3) and to manifest that growth by
a life unlike to the life of this age, or “ this world,'' as the apostle
styles it, in Eph. ii. 2. The import of these words is thus the
same as that of the charge which you read in Eph. iv. vv. 17, 23,
and 24-“ this Ι say, therefore, and charge you by the Lord, that
ye walk no longer as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their
mind ;'’ “but be ye renewed in the spirit of your mind, and put
on the new man ; which, after God, is created unto righteousness
and true holiness? By the term “ mind, (τοῦ νοός,) therefore, I
understand what the apostle means by the same word, when he
