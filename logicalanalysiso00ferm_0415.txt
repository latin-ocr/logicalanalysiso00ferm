EI'JsTLE OF PAUL TO THE ROMANS. 373

‘ Thereforc they are to bc marked and shunncd by the Church,
as idolatcrs, who worship a strange god, name1y7 their own belly!

This effect the apostle amplifies by a contrast :—they “serve
not the Lord J esus Christ, but their own belly ;‘' by which con-
trast it is the intention of the 511051Ιο 10 charge them with ί putting
their own belly in the place of Christ :' for otherwise, it is lawful
in Christ for Christians piously to care for their belly, as for their
other [members]; whence the apostle elsewhere enjoins-‘ that
he who does not work ⁹—that is, ‘who is not piously solicitous
about the satisfying of his belly ’—‘ should not eat,' that is, ζ sa-
tisfy,' or ‘ be permitted to satisfy the wants of his belly' (2 Thess.
iii. 10). “And by fair speaking and flattery,'' Soc. The second
effect fr0m which he proves, as he admonishes, that the authors of
divisions are to be marked and shunned, is 2—-

‘ They seduce the hearts of men :

‘ Therefore, they are to be marked and shunned.’

This effect the apostle amplifies—both by the adjunct of the man—
ner of seducing, and by the adjunct of those men'whose hearts they
seduce. The adjunot of the manner of seducing is——“ fair speak-
ing and flattery ;” which two things differ in this way: that ‘⁶ fair
speaking'' is—‘ the language addressed 10 others by tlte speaker,
enticing them to evil ς’ while “ flattery'' is——‘ our approbation of
the language of others, whereby, in like manner, we seek 10 0111100
them to evil! These seducers, therefore, seduced the hearts of
men, both by speaking what was agreeable to those whom they
seduced, and by approving what they spoke themselves3 both con-
trary to his doctrine. The adjunct of those who were seduced 15
indicated by the apostle when he says, that they were—“ (men)
without malice.”* In 2 Pet. ii. 3, these persons are called—‘ pro-
fessors of the gospcl τ’ for, addressing such, the apostle says—that
those seducere, “ through covetousness, would, with feigned wordS,
make merchandise of'' these same professors; and in the 20111 verse
,of the same chapfthey-are called—such as ‘⁶ have escaped the pol-
lutione of the world, throughthe knowledge of the Lord and Sa-

, ·* maim& malorum.' ..
