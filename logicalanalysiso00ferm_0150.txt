22. “ For I delight in the law of G0d‚ as to the inward man.’'
The apostle now proves each part of the experience and assump-

, tion, brought before us in v. 14, a second time, as we formerly

pointed out in our remarks on the 15th verse. The argument in
proof of the first part of that experience, viZ. ‘ that the law is spi-
ritual’ is taken from the adjunct of the delight of the spirit or in-
ward man :—

( That in which the spirit or inward man *delights is spiritual,
that is, is given by the Spirit and given for life3

‘ But Ι delight in the law of God as to the spirit and inward
man, that is in so far as I am spiritual and renew‘ed ε

The assumption only of the syllogism is here given.

23. “ But I see another law m my members warring against the
law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin
which is in my members.'' This is the proof of the second part.
The argument for it is taken from the efficient cause of our servi-

ruption of our nature. — ,

The law of my members, or the corruption of my nature, brings
me into captivity to the law of sin3

‘ Therefore I am carnal, and sold so as to be made subject to
sin? .
The antecedent is given in the text. Upon these words observe
that by the “law of sin'' is to be understood that dominion and power .
of sin whereby, as by a law, we are compeUed to serve sin? Of this
dominion and power the apostle has previously spoken in c. vi„ v. 12
and 143 where although he denies that the renewed man, and he
who is a child. of grace is under that dominion, yet know that as
there are the remains of sin within us, so the remains of that power
——to which the apostle here complains that he was brought into cap-
tivity by *the law of his members, that is, by the remaining strength
of the corruption of his nature, as if by some law—survive in με
