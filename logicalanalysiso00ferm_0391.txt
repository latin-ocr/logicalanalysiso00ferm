EPISTLE or PAUL To Tnn ROMANS. 349

‘.‘ As reminding you together.’' This is a second epanorthosis of
his confession and mitigation of his boldness, from the subject of
his writing3 which subject is———a “ reminding together ;’' that is—
‘an admonishing, both of himself and them jointly, to lay hold of
offered grace ε’ for ἑπαμιιμνῆσκειν is——‘ to put in mind others as
well as myself,’ or ‘ot-hers also besides myself3’ the force of the
preposition ἐπὶ in composition being such, that ἐπαμιμνῆσκειν
is—‘ to remind you together with myselfi' or ‘to put you in mind
along with myself.' The apostle therefore mitigates the charge
of boldness, in this second epanorthosis, in such a way as to make
it plain to them, that he has written nothing so boldly to them which
he has not also said to himself, and of which he would not remind
himself together with them. “Because of the grace which has
been given to me by God.” Next comes the establishment of his
authority, which he has already proposed by a sort of pious invali-
dating of it3 with a view to shew clearly that he is not bold at all,
but free in Christ, in thus writing to them. The arguments by
which he establishes his freedom are two. The first is contained
in the words quoted 3 and is taken from the efficient cause of the
freedom, namely—‘ the grace given to him from God.' By ‘⁶ grace,''
the apostle here means what, in 1 Cor. ix. 17, he calls—“a dis-
pensation of the gospel committed to him ;’' and which, in 1 Tim.
i. 12, he superadds, as a higher grace, to his own effectual calling
to Christ. In 1 Tim. v. 17, he decrees to this, as a superior grace,
if added to a previous effectual calling to Christ, a twofold honour ·
in the Church. From this grace, the foundation of twofold honour,
conferred upon him, he establishes his authority, and his freedom
in writing either to the Romans, or to any church whatever.

16. “For this, that I should be a minister.’' He now explains
the grace given to him from God, whereby 116-1136 established his
authority, by its general end. The general end is—-‘ the ministry :' ”
Paul asserts that grace has been given to him—“ that he might be
a minister of J esus Christ.'’ The ministry he explains by its three-
fold subject 3 and particular end. The subject is threefold z the sub-
