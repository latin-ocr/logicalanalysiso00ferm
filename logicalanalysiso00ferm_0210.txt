168 LOGICAL ANALYsm or Tm:

to have compassion :’ 4 Therefore to will is not of him that wineth,
nor to run of him that runneth‚ but both to will and to run are
from God that sheweth mercy?

The antecedent is given in the 15th verse, which contains the
testimony of G0d‚ wherein the two following properties of the be-
nevolent affection (ἔυδοκία) of the will of God are set before us:
the first is--‘ to be merciful or mercifully affected towards the
wretched 3’ the second is——‘ from mercy to confer grace upon the
wretched as a remedy for their wretchedness‚ so that they may be
delivered out of it? By hysterosis‚ the order of these is reversed
in the text: for ῙἎΠ, which stands first, signifies—-‘ to shew grace
from mercy,' and, consequently, is the effect of mercy, as we leam
from the expression, of such frequent recurrence in the Psalms—
ΠῚΓῬ ³2:17, “ Be gracious unto me, O J ehovah :'' while ΟΠἾ, which

is put last, is the cause of the former, and means—‘ to have com· -

passion,’ or ‘to be affected with the mercy of a mother towards
her wretched children? So the apostle here renders the words of
Moses in the most correct manner, and by the use of the most ap-
propriate terme: for ἐλεεῖν in the Greek idiom is—‘ to help or do
good to any one from mercy,' whence ἐλεημοσῦνη ‘that which is
given to the wretched to relieve their wretchedness 3' while the
other term ὖικτειρειν denotes—‘ maternal affection,' and most cor-
reetly conveys the force of the original.

16. “ So then it is not of him that wineth, nor of him that
rameth, but of God that sheweth mercy.’' This is the consequent
of the enthymeme whereby it is concluded—that whatever mercy
or grace is bestowed upon us is of God alone, and in no degree
from ourselves.’ All the grace given from mercy is here comprised
by the apostle under two heads, viz. 4 to will ' and ‘ to run ;’ or as
he speaks in Phil. 11. 13, 44 to will and to do.” The conclusion is
therefore expressed in terms of the cause and its effects: ‘ God’
is the sole cause3 4 mercy,’ then ‘ grace conferred from mercy as ·
a remedy for wretchedness,’ are the two effects. The conclusion
is also illustrated by a contra st :—‘ both the mercy, and the grace
