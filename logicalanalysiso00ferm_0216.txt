174 LOGICAL ANALYSIS 01 THE

ticular by which this long-suffering of Gocl is amplified, is its
final end--God endures the wicked with much long-suffering “ to
make known his power :'' for this end he raised up and long
endured Pharaoh3 and for the same end 116 endures all the ves-
sels of wrath. The apostle, therefore, teaches us—not only that
God would be most just, although he should be angry with
the wicked, and inflict punishment upon them, while yet un-
born, and before they had done any evil, as Esau is said to
have been then hated3 but besides, that he is now even long-
suffering and merciful towards them, inasmuch as he permits
them to be born, and long endures them while acting wickedly

after they are born.

towards the vessels of mercy, which he prepared unto glory.'’
This is the second part of the conclusion with its amplification,
having respect, as has been noticed under the preceding verse, 10
1116 elect, who are here described by three circumstances. First,
they are described by their adjunct——they are “vessels of mercy ;''
Secondly, by the effect of that mercy, which is—‘ their prepara-
tion before time (πξοετόιμασις). Moreover, by “mercy,” I un-
derstand here—that ‘love,' of which, in Mal. i. 2, God testifies
that Jacob, although equally wretched with his brother Esau, was
the object 3 and that is just—‘ the purpose ³¹⁶ of God, or benevolent
affection (ἐυδοκία) of his will,’ which belongs to all the children
of God in common with Jacob: by πξοετόιμασις again, or ‘their
preparation stom eternity‚' I consider is meant—‘ their predestina-
tion according to that benevolent affection (ἐυδοκία) of the will
of God? The proximate end of this preparation, which is the
third. circumstance by which the elect are here described, is—
‘ their glory,’ to be accomplished by its own intermediate causes;
“which,'’ says the apostle, via, ‘the vessels of mercy,’ “he be- ,
fore prepared,'' for so the original word signifies‚ “ unto glory.” ·
Such is the description 11616 given of the elect3 and 10 1116111 this ’
