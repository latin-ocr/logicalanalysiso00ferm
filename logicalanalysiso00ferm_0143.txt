EP1sT1AE or PAUL To THE ROMANS. 101

‘ In whatever manner sin sinful works death, in the same manner
it also works in us every sort of lust or Subsequent sin t

‘But original sin works death to us by taking occasion from the
law :'

⁴ Therefore it also works subsequent sins, or those sins to which
it gives rise, by taking occasion from the law.’

The assumption of this syllogism or antecedent of the above
enthymeme is proved by the apostle in these two verses, and the
following one z the argument by which he proves it is taken from
a comparison of ‘dissimilarity between our condition before the law,
and after the law has been exhibited to us, and understood by us ;
and is to the‘hfollowingjeffect :—

⁴ Before the commandment came, that is before the law had
been exhibited to me or was known by me, I was alive, and sin
was dead 3 but when the law came, sin revived, and I died τ’

‘Therefore sins work death in me by occasion of the law? The
antecedent is contained in verse 9 3 the consequent is given in.
verse 11, being illustrated in the lOth verse, by contrast with the
end of the law, which is ‘ life’——‘ the law was given for life ; yet
by occasion of the law, which was given for life, death was wrought
to me.'

12. ‘⁶ So that the law (itself) indeed is holy ε and the com*
mandment holy, and just, and good.''

This is the third part of the reply which commenced at verse
7, and in which the apostle meets the objection, touching the law,
that it is sin. To that objection he here replies, in the third place,
by a contrary affirmation, in which ‘he claims for the law—holiness
in precept, righteousness in the practice of its precepts, and good
or happiness for its end 3 and asserts that these three things follow
ftom his teaching, in as much as he has shewn in the foregoing
discussion, that sin does not proceed from the law, but that every
sin arises from sin by occasion of the law, which itself is not sin.
The whole reply of the apostle to the objection may therefore be
summed up as follows 2-‘ Far be it that it should follow from my
