viz.—‘ their own rejection of the truth of God,’ to both of which
J ude says, that they were “ foreordained of old,'' (πάλαι προγεγξαμ-
μένους,) (J ude iv.) indicating the most remote and primary cause.

The last part of the amplificationis taken from the adjunct of
the time, at the close of verse 8‚-“ even unto this day :’' which
words must be connected with the last clause of verse 7—“ have
become callous,'’ the preceding words in verse 8 being included
within a parenthesis. The same thing is affirmed by the apostle in
2 Cor. iii. 13, 14, from the typica] nature of the law: Moses put
a veil on his face while announcing the law, thereby intimating to
the Jews, that the end of the law, which is Christ, lay hid in a
mystery, under the enwrapment or covering, as it were, of the law,
which veil was not to be taken away except in Christ 3 whence he in-
fers the same thing as he here asserts, namely—‘ that their minds were
hardened, and that the veil remained upon their hearts, in the read-
ing of the Old Testament, even to this day, nor would be taken away
until their hearts should be converted to Christ? This conversion
we do not yet witness even to the present day--as the apostle
speaks of his own age—in the case of the great majority of this nae
tion. The Lord convert both them and us, that the riches of his
goodness in J esus Christ may be glorified in the fulness of the world l

11. “ Ι say.'' Α We have here the second argument, by which the
apostle proves that the Israelites are to be restored to the God of
their salvation, taken from the end of their fall, and that fourfold3
thus 2—-

‘ If the Jews and Israelites in general, who were formerly the
people of God and his visible Church, have yet stumbled against
his Christ—(l.) that through their fall, salvation might come ⁴vto
the Gentiles, (2.) that they themselves might be provoked to emu-
lation on seeing the salvation of the Gentiles, (3.) that through
emulation of the Gentiles some of them might be saved, and (4.)
that their salvation might *be the fulness of the Church of God—

then the Jews and Israelites in general are to be recalled to Christ,
notwithstanding their rejection of him 3
