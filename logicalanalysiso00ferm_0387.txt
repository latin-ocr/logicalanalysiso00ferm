EPISTLE 01⁴* PAUL To THE ROMANS. 345

mends to God this same conclusion of his, thus amplified and
established, that he may work it in their hearts‚ and wishes——
‘that God may fill them with joy and peace,' that is, ‘ so renew
them, that they may rejoice more and more every day, to live in
peace with one another unto God.' For ‘ to be filled with joy,' is
-—‘ to rejoice much,’ and refers to an inward affection3 to be
‘ filled with peace,⁷ again, 18-ζ 10 attain a life of much peace‚’ and
refers to the outward behaviour. “ To be filled with joy,” there-
fore, is—‘ to rejoice daily, more and more, in a life of peace with
one another, from feeling more and more every day, that the joy
of the Holy Spirit is increasing within them, as the result of their
own reconciliation with God.’ This benefit which he wishes for
them, the apostle variously amplifies z first, by its primary efficient
cause, which is-—“ the God of (their) hope ;” next, by the adjunct ⁷
of the manner in which this benefit is effected for them, viz—‘⁴ in'
believing,”*(<rc‡› πιστεύειν); thirdly, by its end—“ that ye may
abound in hope,'' 830. 3 and fourthly, by the adjunct of—‘ his own
persuasion,' in the following verse. As regards the first part of
the amplification‚ 116 calls the author of the joy and peace of
Christians—“ the God of (their) hope,” that is, ‘the God of the
completion of their peace with himself, in the life which is to come?
The foice of the argument is most convincing ,therefore‚ from this
first amplification. for it arises both from authors cxhip, because the
benefit is wished for from God3 and from a further benefit to
come, inasmuch as heis styled—“ the God of hope‚” that 18, ‘ the

' God of the completion of the peace of all who have been reconciled ’

to God in J esus Christ, in the beginning of which here, they
should rejoice, and in the completion of which hereafter, they shall
fully rejoice.’ I come now‘to the second part of the amplification,
or the manner in which the benefit is enjoyed 3 which the apostle
here intimates consists solely in—“ believing,'’ to teach us :—‘ that
neither joy nor peace can either begin here, or be completed here-
-after, except in Christ apprehended by faith, and through Christ
apprehended by faithR “ That ye may abound in hope.” This is
the amplification of the wish of the apostle from its end ε 116 wishes
