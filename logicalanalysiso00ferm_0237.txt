EPISTLE OF PAUL To Tm: ROMANS. 195

‘ Therefore confession of the mouth both follows faith, and the
salvation of all who profess from faith is certain?

12. ‘⁶ For there is no distinction between Jew and Gentile.”
The apostle, in quoting from the ancient Scriptures, having ex-
pounded and taught that what is asserted by the prophet indefi-
nitely—“ he that believcth,” Is. xxviii. 16-is to be taken uni-
versally, and that the meaning is—‘ Whosoever believeth,’ pro-
ceeds to establish his exposition, and to prove that the prophet is
to be understood universally. The argument employed is from the
removal of the distinction, or, as he elsewhere speaks, from ‘ the
breaking down of the middle wall of partition,' by which «Jews and
Gentiles were distinguished under the law, and which, under the
reign of Christ, no longer exists3 whence the apostle thus reasons:
‘ Under the reign of Christ, there is no longer any distinction be-
tween J ew and Gentile, but they are both alike in Christ Jesus’—
this, which is the antecedent, is given in the text: whence the
conclusion.

⁴ Therefore what was formerly said concerning the grace of those
who believe, is now common to any who believe’-“Whosoever be-
lieveth on him shall not be put to shame.’'

“For the same Lord of allf’ He next proves the foregoing
antecedent—‘ that there is no distinction between J ew and Greek 3'
and the arguments by which he proves it are two. The first is
taken, from their common Lord3 for he who, according to mutual
covenant, was the God and Lord of the Israelites, under the law,
is now, under the reign of Christ, the same Lord of all, since
“now,'' under the reign of Christ, as it is said, in Rev. xii. 10,
“is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God.”
“ Is rich towards aU.” The second argument is from the abundance
of the grace of God, which now, under the reign of Christ, is
poured out upon all in common, both Jews and Gentiles 2—-

- ‘ God is rich in mercy towards all, both Jews and Greek:

‘ Therefore‚ whosoever believeth on him shall not be put to
