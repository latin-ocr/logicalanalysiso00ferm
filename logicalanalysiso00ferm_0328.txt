CHAPTER XIII.

Thus far, in chap. xii„ the apostle has prescribed to Christiane
the Christian duties which devolve upon them as members of the
Church of J esus Christ. Since Christians should also live duti-
fully in the world, and without offence among those that are with-
out, he now proceeds, in this 13th chap., to prescribe the duties to
be performed by them in the state. These, like those in the pre-
ceding chap., are partly relative, or such as arise from a particular
respect, as far as ver. 7 3 partly common, thence to ver. 11 ; whence,
to the end of the chap., he winds up, by a common conclusion as it
were, his injunctions of both kinds concerning morals--both those
which are suited to Christians as members of the Church, and
those which are suited to them as members of the state. This
chap., accordingly, consists of three sections: the first treats of the
particular duty of Christians in the state3 the second, of their com-

are superior to them in any way. The state being distributed, ac-
cording to this relation, into superiors and inferiors, the apostle=
distinctly prescribes the duty which inferiors ought to perform to-
wards their superiors3 and from this prescribing, it most evidently
appears what are also the duties tobe performed by superiors to—
wards those who are subject to them in a Christian state. For if

by God3 the president himself also, who is superior to me, is boum}
not to preside, nor to exercise his power over me, beyond what has
been appointed him by the Lord. Therefore, as a Christian man:
sins and violates the Christian duty which he ought to, perform, >if
he does not obey his superior enjoining what is just, and in the
Lord3 so the superior himself also- sins, if he enjoins unjustly, and
