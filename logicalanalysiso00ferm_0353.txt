EPISTLE OF PAUL To THE RoMANs. 311

' to be received by their brethren gent-ly teaching them from the
word of God, which is their'duty, as it is that of the stronger to
receive them. Thus, Paul rebuked, as heretics in Christianity,
those who contended for circumcision (which, nevertheless, he
practised himself, for the sake of the weak, in the case of Timothy),
and, in so doing, declares that this was the sole ground of his con-
troversy with them—‘⁶ moreover I, brethren, if I preach circumci-

than if he were not received3 and consequently the infr-ingement
of duty is greater in the former case, than in the latter. “ Strifes
of disputings.'' By this expression he intends—⁴ wrangling and
contentious disputings, wherein the disputants on both sides so
defend their own opinion, and that often without evident reason,
as to make it plain that neither party is secking the truth from
the solid foundations of truth, for mutual edification, but each
the victory over the other, to the vainglorying of the victor, and
disgrace of thessvanquished. Such strifes of disputings would
.be a short method of proceeding, if any one wished to render a
weak brother obstinate, and therefore the apostle, as if correct-
ing the words of his own injunction, prohibits the stronger from
