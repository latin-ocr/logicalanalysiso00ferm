40 LOGICAL ANALYsIs or THE

illustrates the foregoing and implied conclusion concerning the
conviction of the Jews by the testimonies addueed out of the
seriptures, from its twofold end ε the first is,—‘ that every mouth
may be stopped, not among the Gentiles only, but also among the
Jews 3 ' the second is‚—‘ that the whole world may become liable
to the condemnation of God, the Jews no less than the Greeks?
For while in the opinion of the Jews, it was beyond dispute that
the Greeks and Gentiles were sinners, they were by no means dis-
posed to admit that the same thing was true of themselves3 as
appears from Gal. ii. 15, where ‘to be a J ew by nature’ is opposed
to ‘ being a sinner of the Gentiles : ⁹ the apostle therefore applies
convincing testimonies from the scriptures to the Jews also, that,
they too being self-convieted and brought in guilty, he may
obtain the universal conclusion, ‘that every man, both J ew and
Greek, holds the truth of God in unrighteousness, and‚’ as he ex-
presses it in Gal. iii. 22, ⁴ is shut up under sin by the law?

20. “ Therefore from the deeds of the law shall no flesh be
justified in his sight.’' The reasoning in proof of the assumption
of the first syllogism‚ which has been prosecuted from the 18th
verse of chap. i. to this place, is here brought to a conclusion 2——
‘ the righteousness of man in the sight of God is not from the law,
nor its deeds? “For through the law is the knowledge of sin.’'

“ 'We have here a new argument for the assumption which has just

been concluded‚ taken from the contrary effect pf the law which
is to make known sin and misery :—

‘ Sin and unrighteousness became known by the law :’

‘Therefore righteousness and salvation do not become known?
from the law, but from the other part of the word, namely, from
the gospel? Ι

Thus the apostle here assigns to each part of the word its own
⁷ and its proper effect: so that it is the office of the law to make
known sin, and to threaten death as the consequence of sin; but-
of thegospel, to make manifest the remission of sins in Christ Je-
suS, unto righteousness and eternal life.
