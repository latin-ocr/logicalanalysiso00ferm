254 LOGICAL ANALYsIS OF THE

says above, chap. vii. ver. 25—<‘ with the mind indeed, I myself
serve the law of God 3⁹⁹ and which he himself, in the 22d verse of
the same chapter, has before interpretes] [by the expression]—-“ as
regards the inward man,'' (κατὰ τὸν ἔσω ἄνθρωπον) : ‘⁴ the mind,’'
therefore, in this place, is—‘ the inward man,' which, in Eph. iv.
24, is called—‘⁴ the new man,” that is—-‘ the whole and entire na-
ture of man, in so far as he is renewed,' or, as the apostle speaks,
-“ is created (anew) unto righteousness and true holiness.’' By
‘⁶ renewal,’' (demnatum-tm) again, Ι understand—not that whereby
“the mind,’'* or ‘inward man ’ is renewed more and more day by
day, but—⁴ that whereby we ourselves are renewed at first, so
that we become inward men and new creatures.' Or you may
prefer to understand the term ‘⁴ mind ’' here in the same sense as
that in which it is used in Eph. iv. 17, naniely, as—‘ the old
mind, and such as was that of the Gentiles without God3' and
with this exposition, what is here added-“ your ”—seems to
agree, because what the mind of the Gentiles and those who still
remain in their natural state is now, that the mind of the renewed
also was before they were renewed: therefore, when addressing
the renewed, he says—“ be ye transformed by the renewal of your
mind,'’ their “mind’' may be well enough understood as—‘ that
which they had before they were renewed 3’ and, taken in this
sense, “the renewal” (ἠ ἀνακαινώσις) will be—not that of our-
selves, as we are by nature into the “ mind,'’ or new man, but—
‘that of the old mind (τοῦ νοὸς) into the new mind? Otherwise,
this ‘ transformation' (μετασχημάτισις) will be—‘ the transfigura-
tion of ourselves, whereby having been renewed in spirit, we so
change—in thought, word, and deed—our formerly impure nature,
that we become unlike to the world, and to what we ourselves were
when in the world, being assimilated to God,’ that is—-“ created
(anew) after (the image of) God, in righteousness and true holi-
ness.'’ Three things are worthy of our notice here. The first
is—that our renewal commences with the mind 3 whence it
follows, that before our renewal, the mind itself, and the “wis-
