EPISTLE OF PAUL To THE ROMANs. 143

fies ;' this, which is the proposition, is obvious, because ‘the glory
to be revealed' is the felicity and supreme good of man, and be-
cause all intermediate things turn out for good to those to whom
this is allotted as the termination of their troubles: hence the
apostle subjoins the assumption,—-‘ But God glorifies those who
were foreknown ε
‘ Therefore all things turn out for good to those who were
foreknown.'
The assumption is here the point to be settled, andis proved
from the immediate effect of the foreknowledge of God, or his
purpose agreeably to that foreknowledge: this effect is ⁴ predes-
tination,' which is also the more remote cause to men of their
glorification or highest good. The syllogism by which it is proved
Ι runs thus :—
‘ God glorifies all who were predestinated to life 3
‘ But he predestinated all who were foreknown :
- ‘ Therefore whom he foreknew he glorifies 3'
> Which is the assumption of the first syllogism. The assumption
of this last syllogism, ‘ God predestinated those whom he fore-
knew,’ is given in the commencement of verse 29, and illustrated
in the remainder of the verse by the twofold end of predestination,
viz. : the proximate, which is--‘ our conformity to the image of his
Son, first in the cross, and then in the kingdom,—first in patient
endurance, and afterwards in glory 3' and the more remote, which
is,—‘ that J esus Christ may be “the first-born,'' (vrgco‘t6‘tonog,) that
is, the first and forerunner, “among many brethren,’' in each of
the aforesaid particulam, namely, in patient endurance and glory,
in the cross and kingdom? The assumption of the last syllogism,
viz.—‘ that God predestinated those who were foreknown,’ being
thus established, the proposition, namely, ‘that God 'glorifies those
who were predestinated,’ remains as the point to be settled: this
the apostle proves, in the following words, from the immediate
effect of predestination, which is,—‘ our effectual calling to grace ;'

and he proves it as follows :—
‘ God glorifies all whom he calls ;’
