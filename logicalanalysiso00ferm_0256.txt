just reward of their error is, that the law which was given for a
table, or spiritual nourishment, should become a snare. The last
expression to be considered here is, “the bowing down of the
back,’' which metaphorically denotes—-‘ the judgment of those who
lie under, and sink beneath, the intolerable burden of the wrath of
God? The definition of ‘hardening,' therefore, is this—-‘ a spirit
of deep sleep, or a deep sleep inflicted by God through an evil
spirit, so closing the eyes, ears, and mind against the ministry of
the word, that the very table itself, i. e., the sacred ministry of the
word, which should be for spiritual nourishment, becomes death to
those who are in this condition, and being thus dead, they remain
under wrath for ever.'

The hardening of the Jews is next amplified from its cause,
which also is indicated in the testimonies to be the ‘ giving‚'
‘ making,' ⁴ bowing down,' whereby Grod gives them a spirit of
deep sleep, makes their table a snare, and bows down their backs.
If it be inquired—-what is meant by this ‘ giving ‘?' I answer—-it
is ‘ the effectual execution of the will of God, whereby, from eter-

of the sacred ministry of the word intervening ς’ for although they
were made those left by election before they had a being, because
it is not only written—“ J acob have I loved,’' but also—“ Esau
have I‘hated,’' yet, previous to their being afflicted with this hard-
ening, and before that spirit of deep sleep is given to them, they
reject the knowledge of God and the love of the truth, as the
apostle says, c. i. 21, 26—“ because that though they knew God,
they glorified him not as G0d‚ therefore God abandoned them to
vile affections,’' and, 2 Thess. ii. 11, 12-“ because they received
not the love of the truth that they might be saved, therefore God
sends to them the effectual working of error, that they may believe
alie, and that all may be condemned who have not believed the
truth, but have had pleasure in unrighteousness.” The cause of this
hardening, therefore, is of three degrees: the proximate cause is—
‘ thejudgment of God, whereby a spirit of deep sleep is given or sent
to them? Prior to this is the cause of that judgment or sending,
