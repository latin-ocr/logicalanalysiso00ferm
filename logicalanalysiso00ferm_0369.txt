EPISTLE OF PAUL TO THE ROMANS. 327

from God or from men3 for as regards God, imputed righteous-
ness alone works acceptance with him. By “ men'' Ι understand
here—‘ the Church of G0d‚’ which, being endued with the Spirit,
is both able to discern,rand does discern, spiritual things, and
through the Spirit acknowledges that all things are rightly done,
and omitted, which are freely done or omitted for the edification
of even the weakest members in the Church: unless you prefer,
by the term “ men,” to understand—‘ men in general,’ whether in

and mutual edification, but puts a cause of offence in the way of
a weak brother:

‘ Therefore,' 8⁶0.

20. “Destroy not, for the sake of food, the work of God.” By
“the work of God,’' Ι understand here-‘ the beginning of the
good work in J esus Christ which God works in weak brethren;’
concerning which the apostle recommends to the strong, not to de-
·stroy that work of God, by inciting the weak to do things ’ which
to themselves appear evil, and, comequenssy, to fall back from that
