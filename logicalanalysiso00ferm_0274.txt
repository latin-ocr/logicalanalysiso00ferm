tude, the name of ‘the Israelitish nation,’ and of ‘all the peo-
ple.' Thus, in the days of Elijah, the seven thousand Israelites,
who had not bowed the knee to Baal, when the great majority and
body of the people of J ehovah, during the reign and apostaey of
Ahab, had apostatized from Jehovah, killed his prophets, and dug
down his altars, were a part of Israel (see above, ver. 4); so, in
the time of Paul, was that very small number of Jews who embraced
J esus Christ, while the great majority were apostatizing and
denying him, and who are therefore called by the apostleain vv.
1 and 2 of this chap. ‘ the people of God, whom God has not cast
away :’ this very small number of Jews, I say, is called a ‘ part of
Israel ;’ to which part if we oppose what the apost-le here says,
“all Israel shall be saved,'’ then ‘⁴ all Israel” will be ‘the great

the fulness of the Gentiles shall have been brought in, the great
majority of the Israelitish people are to be called, through the
gospel, to the God of their salvation, and shall profess and own
J esus Christ, whom formerly, that is, during the time of hardening,
they denied, and that the prediction of a blessed seed, made to
Abraham their father, has been fulfilled.’ This interpretation of
the passage is most pertinent to the scope of the present discus-
sion3 but because that recal of the Israelites is not yet witnessed
-in respect to the majority, (κατὰ πλῆθος,) most interpreters ex-,
plain the passage differently, and understand what the apostle here v
says—“ all Israel shall be saved,’' of Israel in spirit, and also of all
Israelites according to the flesh„who at any time have. believed,
