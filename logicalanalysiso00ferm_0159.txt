in fine, because this effect of deliverance is in Christ, and not out
of Christ3 for the other gifts of the Spirit of God are perceived
both in the world and out of Christ 3 but this gift of deliverance,
and by which one is certain of his own salvation, belongs to the
elect alone, nor is any where perceived, except in the mystical
Christ and the members of his body 3 this is the second part of
the description of the Spirit from his subject. Secondly, you must
know that when it is said—‘⁴ the law of the Spirit hath delivered
me,'' this is not to be understood, of the effectiny of that deliverance,
for Christ has effected our deliverance by his death3 but the law

⁷ the flesh, God, sending his own son in a form like to that of fiesh
subject to sin, and for sin condemned sin in the flesh. .

“ That the rights of the law may be fulfilled in us.’' This is
the proof of the foregoing assumption, from the subject and end of
the gospe13 the subject being set forth in two parts. The first
part of -the subject isa-‘othe mission of the Son in the flesh,’ or
