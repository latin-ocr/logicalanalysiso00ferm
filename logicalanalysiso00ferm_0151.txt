EPISTLE OF PAUL To THE ROMANS. 109

is brought into captivity, and the strength of sin by which he is
made captive, the apostle explains by their subject 3 both are ‘ in
our members ς’ and by their effect, which is, ‘ the struggle of the
law of sin against the law of the mind? By “the law of the mind'’
I understand the Spirit, or the power of the renovating Spirit in the
new creature3 for so the apostle himself explains it in Gal. v. 17,
where ⁴ the law of the members’ is called ί( the flesh,’⁷ and ⁴ the law
of the mind’ styled “ the> Spirit;’' and where, just as here, he
teaches that these are contrary and repugnant the one to the other.
By this the apostle would have us learn that as there are in the
Christian, so long as he continues in this world, two men, as we
have before observed on v. 18, viz.—“ the flesh'' and ⁴⁴ the Spirit”
or “ mind,’' or—“ the old man” and “ the new man⁷' “ new crea-
ture’' or inward man ;” so between these two there is a perpetual
struggle going on during the whole of our life below3 for the law
of the members carries on war against the law of the mind, as he
here speaks, and “the flesh coveteth against the Spirit,’' as he says
in the passage cited from Ga1.; and so fierce is the struggle, that,
as the apostle testifies of both sides-J we cannot do the good that
we would, but the evil that we would not, that we do.’

24. “ Oh wretched man that I am ! who shall deliver me from
this body of death ?'’ Thus far the assumption and comparison of
dissimilarity between ourselves and the law, given in verse 14, has
been proved3 whence,v the apostle here deduces the conclusion of
the syllogism, which forms the reply to the objection of which we
spoke in our remarks on the 13th verse—‘ therefore, sin is become
death unto me,' or, which is the same thing—‘ my body is a body
of sin, until I be delivered theresrom? I take “body ’' here to be
the opposite of ‘⁴ mind,’' and as “ mind ” is used for ‘ the inward
man,’ so Ι understand “ body '’ as signifying ‘ the outward man,’
in which the apostle has formerly declared that no good dwells.
The apostle does not content himself with barely drawing this
conclusion, but sets itoff with a rhetorical exclamation and ana-
coenosis—‘⁶ Oh wretched man that I am who shall deliver me from
