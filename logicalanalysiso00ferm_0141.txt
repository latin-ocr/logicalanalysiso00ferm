when it is explained and thoroughly taught, so that it may be un-
derstood 3 of which knowledge, as before remarked, there are two
parts, viz.——⁴ what it is,’ and ‘that it is an evil? Both of these
parts, the ozatmval philosophers and sensual men reached in. a mea-
sure, but not one of them ever fully explained : as the apostle
shews by this example of covetousness, adduced from the law,
which none of the wise men or philosophers of this world knew to
be either a sin 01· an evil ε for the philosophers knew something of
the inward motions and depraved lusts which J ames calls ‘the
conceiving of sin 3' but of the impure and covetous fountain of
covetousness, that is—the ruin of our nature, and of the flesh co-
veting against the spirit, the philosophers neither possessed nor
imparted any knowledge3 the law of God having first disclosed
this impure fountain to men. Under the name of ⁴⁴ lust,'’ there-

the first place, that the meaning of the above conclusion—⁴ the law
is not sin,’—is—-⁴ that the law is not the cause of sin,’ or ⁴ that the
law does not work or produce sin ς’ as appears from the other
member of the contrast, where instead of saying—⁴ sin is lust,' *as
he might have done, the apostle says—⁴⁴ Sin worketh lust?
Again, you must know, that 44 sin’' in the latter member of the
contrast means—⁴ both original sin, and that sin sinful, as well
'actually in the first man, as naturally and inherently from him in
each of his posterity :⁷ for both of these are concerned in the pro-
duction of subsequent sins. And, thirdly, 'Know that the term
44 lust⁹⁹ is here used by s51necd00he for ‘every sin that arises from

original sin.” The meaning of the contrast, therefore, is this ;-,
