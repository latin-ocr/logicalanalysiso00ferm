of which they have become branches broken off-—‘ the unbelief
(ἀπιστίαν) of the Jews ς’ and, on the other, he points to ‘ the faith
(πίστιν) whereby Christ and the blessing of Abraham in him,
are apprehended,’ as the cause of the engrafting of the Gentiles.
From these causes he thus reasons 1-—

‘ If they have fallen away by unbelief, and you stand by faith,
you must not glory against them as not to be recalled, but should
fear for yourself, lest, like them, you fall away from the root by
unbelief 3

‘ But the former is true z

‘ Therefore so is the latter.’

The hypothetical proposition is omitted as obvious 3 for it is clear
that he who stands by saith, and sees others falling by unbelief,
should take heed to himself, lest he, in like manner, disbelieve, but
ought not to glory against those who fall by unbelief, as being him-
self exposed to the same danger with them. The assumption is
contained in the words quoted :—“ Be not high-minded, but fear.”
This is the conclusion of the hypothetical syllogism, where, by
‘ high-mindedness,' we are to understand—the presumptuous glo-
rying of the Gentiles against the J ews3 while the ‘fear' which he
recommends to them is—that of children, whereby believers fear,
lest, through sinful glorying, either against God or against another,
they should, as a recompense,* be deprived of God's presence and

favour.

21. “For if God spared not the natural branches, [take heed]
lest he also spare not thee.’' This is the second argument, whereby
he proves the inconclusiveness of the objection of the Gentiles,
namely—‘ that the Gentiles ought not to glory against the Jews,
because they have fallen away stom their root by unbelief, but
should rather fear for themselves, lest they disbelieve in like man,-
ner. The argument is taken from the adjunct of the severity of
,Grod in punishing unbelief, which the apostle proves that the Gren-

tiles should fear, by a comparison of majority, in this way :—
