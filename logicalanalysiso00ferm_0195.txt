EPISTLE or PAUL To THE ROMANs. 153

CHAPTER IX.

N ext comes the destructive reasoning and refutation of those
arguing for the people of the law: For as the former destructive
reasoning, from the 20tl1 ver. of chap. v. to chap. viii„ was a refu-
tation of those that argued for the law against faith3 so is the pre-
sent destructive reasoning a refutation of those arguing for the
people of the law against grace, wherein the apostle obviates the
offence of the gospel arising from the opposition of the Jews, who
were the people of God and the visible Church. The following,
therefore, seems to be the form which the objection would take ι

‘If this, which you announce, were the way of salvation, and
there were no condemnation to those who are in Christ J esus, then
the Church of God, which is the nation of the Jews, would have
embraced this way? This proposition, the opponents seem to have
founded upon the privileges of that people, enumerated in verses 4
and 5 following, but especially upon the last-mentioned preroga-
tive, whereby Christ is said to have descended from the J ews3
for how should others not reject that Saviour whom ‘ his own do
not receive ?' So Pilate reasoned, John xviii. 353 and so the Gen-
tiles, who opposed the gospel, seem here to object to Paul, sub-
joining for the assumption :--

‘ But the nation of the Jews reject this way3

‘ Therefore this is not the true way of salvation, nor is there free-
dom from condemnation through Christ?

Or, if you prefer it, the objection may be thus deduced, enthy-
mematically :—

‘ The Jews, who are the people of God, and the visible Church for
whom the law was ordained‚ to whom the promises were given, who
are themselves descended from the fathers, and from whom Christ
descended——reject this way of salvation'—as the unbelieving Jews
at Rome afterwards openly objected, (Acts xxviii. 22 ε)

‘ Therefore this way of salvation which you announce is not the

true way, nor are those who are in Christ J esus free from condem-
nation.’
