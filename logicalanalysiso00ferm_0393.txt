EPISTLE OF PAUL To THE ROMANS. 351

the apostle acknowledges, that it was by J esus Christ that he had
been put into the ministry, so he here ascribes it to J esus Christ ,
alone, that he ean be free, or may glory, in preaching the gospel.
“In the things which pertain to God.” This is a second illustra-
tion of his ‘ glorying’ or ‘ freedom,’ from its subject : ί Paul glories,
or is free, neither in sinning nor in any of the things of the world,
but in the things which pertain to God3 that is, in the business of
preaehing the gospel of God7' or ⁴ the dispensation of the mysteries
of the kingdom of heaven,' as he elsewhere speaks, (1 Cor. iv. l.)

18. Next comes the second argument for this freedom‚ drawn
from its effect. The effect is—‘ the inducing of the Gentiles to
the obedienoe of Christ :’ and this is amplified, first, by its primary
cause, which is—-‘ Christ 3’ secondly‚ by the instrumental or sub-
ordinate cause, the instrumental cause, or instrument of J esus
Christ being—³ Paul :⁹—

‘ Through me⁷ Paul, Christ has induced the Gentiles to obedi-
enee·

‘ Therefore Ι have whereof Ι may glory, or Ι ean use freedom 1n
speaking and writing to the Gentiles?

The antecedent of this enthymeme‚ which 1s given in verse 18,
is there also proved 3 and, is variously amplified from that verse as
far as verse 22. “ For I have not dared to speak of any thing ex-
cept what Christ hath wrought through me.'' The proof of the
antecedent is taken from the adjunot of its——‘ attestation 2⁹——

’ ‘ J esus Christ knows that I speak the truth‚ and that I dare not
speak of what he does not work through me:

‘ Therefore, it is true that througho me, Paul, J esus Christ has
induced the Gentiles to obedience?

“ In inducing the Gentiles to obedience? ’ This· is the consequent
of the last enthymeme‚ and antecedent of the second argument 2—-
·‘ J esus Christ has induced the Gentiles to obedience throughme
Paul? But, ‘ for the Gentiles to be induced to obedienee,’. denotes
these two things z-ss-both ‘ faith ς’ and ‘ the obedience of saith!
- Therefore, such is the work which J esus Christ wrought through
