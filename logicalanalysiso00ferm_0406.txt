364 LOGICAL ANALYSIS OF THE

said to be taken, either from the spiritual adjunct of Phoebe herself
-ζ she was a female engrafted on Christ the Lord ς’ 01· from the
efficient cause, vi2.—-‘ the Lord of the Romans and of Phoebe,'
namely, ‘ J esus Christ,' participation in whom should induce them
to receive her. “ As befitteth saints.’' The second argument of the
clearing of the first end, is taken from the adjunct of ζ the duty of
saints :’--—‘ it becomes saints, or those who are in the Lord, to re·—
ceive those who are sanctified in the same Lord.' ‘⁶ And that ye
may assist her in whatever matter,'' effic. This is the second end,
amplified by its subject z-—‘ that they should assist her in every
business requiring their assistance.' From this I would have you
observe‚ that it is lawful and customary for saints to commend
saints, even in common and externa] affairs: thus Paul commends

to myself also.'’ He illustrates the effect by a comparison of ma·-
jority :—‘ she has shewn hospitality, not only to other saints, but
to myself also,’ namely, ‘ to Paul.'

first are those of Paul himself, in which he, by himself, salutes the

far as v. 163 then all in common, in the 16th v.; both of which he
winds up by an admonition and prayers, from the 17th to the 21³1:
.. verse. The salutations of Paul wherein he salutes the more dis-
tinguished and eminent in the church at Rome, are partly of single
persons, who are named individually3 and partly of several, who
are included in a sort of common abridgment and description.
Both are enumerated, one after another, in succession3 not sepa-
rately however, but in passing, and jointly, as suits the occasion.
¹.‹‘. Salute Priscilla and Aquila.’' The first who are saluted by
name are—Priscillaand Aquila. Nor should we omit to notice,
