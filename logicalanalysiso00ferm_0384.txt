342 LoeloAL ANALYSIS OF THE

true G0d‚’ and ‘exultation in him as his sole deliverer ς’ and these
not only in the kingdom already given to him, or within the ter-
ritories of the people of God, but also among the neighbouring
Gentiles whom God had subdued under him. This is the type.
The thing signified by the type is—‘ the man Christ Jesus,’ who had
to contend, for man's deliverance, with the old serpent, and all his
power3 over whom his Father gave him the victory, through the
deity that dwelt in him ε and, like David, so he too promises eon-
fession with the mouth, and exultation3 and these, not merely
among God’s ancient people, but also among the Gentiles to the
utmost ends of the earth. There is, however, an observable dif-
ference between the type, and the Lord himself who was signified
by the type. David promises the confession of his own mouth,
and the exultation of his own heart3 that is—‘ that he would
both confess J ehovah as his God, and exult in him whither-
soever he went :’ but when the similitude is applied to the man
J esus, the meaning is :—‘ that the man J esus Christ, having been
exalted by the power of God above the old serpent, and all his
crew, will invite the world to the confession of God, and exultation
in the Lord3 not with his own mouth merely—because he was
about to ascend to his father—but with the mouths and hearts of
those who should reap spiritual advantage from his victory3 and
these, not only Israelites—who should confess and exult from a con-
seiousness of the imputation of Christ's victory to themselves-„but
the elect of God from among all the Gentiles, to the utmost ends
of the whole earth? By this effect of ‘the confession and exulta·-
tion of the Gentiles,’ therefore, the apostle here proves their
effectual calling, and the end of their calling, viz. :—‘ that God, ,in
Christ, has given remission of sins unto salvation to them also,
that they too may extol J ehovah for his mercy in Christ J esus?

10, “ Rej0ice ye Gentiles with his people.'’ This is a common
exhortation to Israel, and the GentileS, to rejoice in J ehovah on u>-
co'unt of the common salvation, bestowed upon both aster long de-
solation under the vongeance of God, which the Israelites, as well as
