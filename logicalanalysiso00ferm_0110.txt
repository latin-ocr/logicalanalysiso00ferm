[38 LOGICAL ANALYSIS or THE

grace with our God is here illustrated by its principa] efficient
cause, namely——“ our Lord J esus Christ,” through whom we have
this access into grace3 by its instrumental efficient cause, viz—-
“ faith 3⁷⁹ and finally, by its effect, which is—to “ stand'’ or ‘per-
severe therein.9 From this we may learn, in passing, that the
perseverance of the saints is the proper and inseparable effect of
their reconciliation through Christ3 so that having once been re-
conciled and received again into grace through our Lord J esus
Christ, they can never afterwards fall from that grace either
entirely or finally, as our Lord himself teaches us in John xiii. 1,
—“ having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them
unto the end.’' “ And glory in hope of the glory of God.’' The
third effect ofjustification from saith, or, if you please, and perhaps
more correctly, the second effect of reconciliation, springing from
reconciliation itself and the consciousness of perseverance with
which it is accompanied, is—‘ the glorying of the saints? This
glorying is here illustrated by its proximate cause, viz.—“ the hope
of the glory of God,” that is of the glory which is laid up for
the saints, and which 15 hid with God in J esus Christ3 of which
glorying you may see an example in chap. viii. of this epistle, verses
33, 34, 35, with its foundation and cause, verse 38. The analysis
which is here presented of the causes of our blessedness and peace
with God is worthy of our attention : the first is--justification by
faith in J esus Christ: the second—the reconciliation through
Christ of those who are justified3 hence perseverance, and the
hope of the glory of God3 and from these peace and glorying
therein.

3. ‘⁴ And not only so, but we even glory in tribulations.” He
next amplifies the glorying of hope by a comparison of majority z
-—‘ we glory not only in hope of the glory of God, but even in
tribulations 3' that is—-the tribulations of the saints and the things
which they suffer, because of their hope, from the world and in the
world, do not diminish their glorying in this hope, but are, as it
were, the instrumental causes of increasing it, or, as others under-
