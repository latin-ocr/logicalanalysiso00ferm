212 Locren. ANALYSls or THE

deep sleep had so spread among the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
during the time of Christ's walking in the flesh, that it caused him
to weep when he approached and looked upon that city, (Luke
xiX. 42.) ‘⁴ then he drexv near and beheld the city, he wept over
it, and said, Oh, that thou knewest, at least in this thy day, the
things that belong to thy peace, but now (these things) are hid
from thine eyes.” Then the apostle does not say that God gave
them ‘deep sleep,’ but ‘⁴ a spirit of deep sleep,’' to teach us that,
as God distributes his gifts to his people through his own Spirit
dwelling in them, as it is written, (1 Cor. xii. 4,) “ There are di-
versities of gifts, but (there is) one Spirit ;” so he inflicts his judg-
ments upon those who are left behind through evil spirits, as the
avengers of sin and ministers of wrath. Both these truths are
clearly set forth in the Scriptures3 the first in Isaiah xi. 2, where
you will find—‘⁴ the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit
of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of
J ehovah,''— put for—⁴ wisdom and understanding, counsel and
might, knowledge and the fear of J ehovah, proceeding from the
indwelling Holy Spirit of Jehovah3’ the latter in 1 Tim. iv. 1,
where the apostle himself explains what he means by “ deceitful
spirits and doctrines of demons,” namely—‘ false doctrine, by the
just judgment of God, put into the mouths of false teachers by
means of devils and evil spirits—just as we read in 1 Kings xxii.
21, 22, 23, of a lie being suggested by an evil spirit to the prophete
of Ahab, to persuade Ahab to his own destruction. In the same
way, throughout the Scriptures, ‘ a spirit of infirmity,’ ‘ of fornica-
tion,’ ‘ of covetousness,' ‘ of giddiness,'* are put for these evils pro-
ceeding from God through an evil spirit. Thus, in 1 Sam. xvi. 15,
it is said that “an evil spirit from Jehovah troubled Sau1;’' and,
in Mark ix. 17, one who had been struck by God, through an evil
spirit, with inability to speak, (ἀλαλίοεὴ is spoken of as having
“a dumb spirit ;’' but this most manifestly appears from Matt.
xii. 43, where, by the “ unclean spirit going. out,’' is denoted-
‘ the uncleanness expelled for a time by the power of the ministry ;‚'
