tiles would bring against the Jews3 and these, as wc have said,
are two. The first objection is this :—

‘ The J eWS, by rejecting Christ, have been broken off and fallen
away, like withered branches from their root :

‘ Although, therefore, the root and the first fruits of the nation
be holy, yet they themselves are not holy, nor to be recalled to
God?

“ And you being a wild olive,’' Soc. The second objection
which he foresaw that the Gentiles would bring against the Jews
is set> forth by opposites, and is to this effect :—--

‘ Although Ι have hitherto been a wild olive,’ some one of the
Gentiles might say, ‘ yet am I now engrafted into the true olive-
tree, and that in place of the Jews who were broken off as withered
branches 3 and Ι have become a partaker of the root which you
say is holy, instead of those who were broken off:

‘ Therefore I am to remain in the root, and the Jews are not to
be recalled.'

These are the objections of the Gentiles against the Jews, to
which the apostle here replies, and his reply consists of two parts.
The first given in this 17th verse contains a concession, whereby
the apostle concedes to the Gentiles the two following things:
First, he concedes ‘ that the Jews were broken off as withered
branches3' yet by way of sostening this apostacy of the Jews as a
check to the triumphing of the Gentiles over them, he says, by
meiosis,*-that “some of the branches were broken of.'' The se-
cond thing which he concedes is this-—‘ that they themselves,
namely, the Gentiles, have been engrafted into the root of the
Jews, and made partakers of the fatness of the true olive-tree ;’

as it is also elsewhere said, without a figure—that “ they who are
of saith are the children of Abraham,” (Gal. iii. 7.)

⁸ 18. “ Yet glory not,’' 850. This is the latter part of the reply,

in which, by epanorthosis, he admonishes the Gentiles, ‘ although .
⁴ · engrasted into the true olive, yet not to glory against the branches.’
