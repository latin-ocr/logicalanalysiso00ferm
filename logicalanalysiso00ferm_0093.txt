EPISTLE OF PAUL TO THE ROMANS. 51

useful “until the time of reformation :'' Secondly, by the regene-
ration begun in us here, whereby even here we commence that
obedience to the law which we shall fully yield in a future life3 for
in these two ways, viZ„ by its use and fulfilment, and the lat-ter
twofold, perfect in J esus Christ, and begun in us, the righteous-
ness of faith and the preaching thereof at length establish the law,
by bringing about- its fulfilment. The apostle therefore rejects that
calumny concerning the law being rendered useless through the
righteousness of faith, as directed not against himself, but against
the truth of God. And thus far the first argument for the point
in dispute, or for the righteousness of saith, has been prosecuted ;
as was stated under the 18th verse of chap. i.

CHAPTER IV.

In this chapter follows the second argument whereby the apostle
proves that man is justified by saith, taken from the case of Abra-
ham who was “the father of them that believe,'' and whose justi-
fication was to serve as a precedent in the case of all who were
afterwards to be justified, and to his whole seed according to the
spirit. The argument runs thus :—

‘ Abraham was not justified before God from the works of the
law but by saith, and the imputation of the righteousness of saith:

‘ Therefore righteousness is from faith and not from the works
of the law!

Theproof of the consequence is added :—

‘ It was written that Abraham was justified by the imputation
of righteousness through faith, says the apostle, for our sakes, to
whom it was afterwards to be imputed 3 that is, in order that we
might know that we were in like manner to be justified by the im-
putation of the righteousness of saith:

‘ Therefore, if Abraham was justified by faith and not from the

. works of the law, righteousness is from faith and not from the-

law.’ The antecedent of the argumentis discussed from v.
