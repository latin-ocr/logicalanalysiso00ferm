EPISTLE OF PAUL To THE ROMANS. 129

16. “Which same Spirit beareth witness, along with our spirit,
that we are the sons of God.'’ This is the second argument,
whereby, both the proposition, which is expressed in verse 14, and
the assumption, which, as we have remarked on that verse, is un-
derstood, are established. This argument is taken from a twofold
testimony: the one divine, being that of the indwelling Holy Spirit,
“which Spirit‚”—viz.‚ ‘ the Holy Spirit and Spirit of adoption,'
--“beareth witness,” says the apostle: the other immam—being
that of our own spirit, now renewed by the Holy Spirit‚—“ beareth
witness,” says he, ‘⁴ along with our spirit.'’ These Spirits, there-
fore,—-both the Holy Spirit and our spirit,——renewed by him, as
two witnesses, cry within us, and unitedly testify that God is our
Abba, Father, and that we are the sons of God in Christ, the only
begotten Son. Both of these ories or testimonies, as well that of
the Holy spirit, as that of our own spirit, renewed by him, I con-
ceive to be included in faith3 for the Holy Spirit ories and bears
witness to us that we are the sons of God, by working saith in us,
and sealing us in J esus Christ 3 and our own spirit, renewed by
him, in like manner eries and bears witness to us that we are the
sons of God, by apprehending, by faith, J esus Christ, and the
grace which, through the Holy Spirit, is revealed in him. From
this twofold inward testimony of the Spirit arises the outward cry
and sacred invoking, whereby the elect call upon God, as their
F ather unto righteousness and salvation3 for so the apostle him-
self seems to explain his meaning, farther on, when he says, (chap.
x. verses 13, 14,) “Whosoever shall call upon the name of the
Lord shall be saved,’' and, immediately after, “How shall they
eall upon him on whom they have not believed ?’' We see, there·
fore, that the invoking or outward cry arises from the inward cry
or saith, and that both are unto salvation.

17. “But if sons, also heirs 3 heirs indeed of God‚ and joint
heire with Christ.'' Thus far the proof of our being sons. He
now proceeds to establish the second member, viz.-—‘ that we are
heire of God with Christ,' the argument for which is taken from
