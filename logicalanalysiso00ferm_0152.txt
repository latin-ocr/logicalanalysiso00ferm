this body of death ?'’ as if he had said—‘ this body is a body of
death, and death makes me wretched ; who shall deliver me from
it :³³

25. “ I give thanks to God, through J esus Christ our
Lord.'' This is a hypophora, or the subjoined reply to the anacoe-
nosis—‘God has delivered me through ‚J esus Christ our Lord?
This deliverance through Christ he intimates by the result and
effect of a consciousness of that deliverance being begun, which
effect of our deliverance upon us is-——‘ our giving thanks :⁹ for he
cannot but give thanks who is conscious that he has been delivered
from sin through Christ apprehended by faith (as has been for-
merly shewn), and from death through the righteousness of Christ
(which is immediately to be proved 3 this hypophora being an
epitome and compendium of the constructive reasoning of both
discussions.) “ So then I myself with the mind indeed serve the
law of God ; but with the flesh the law of sin.’' This is the eom-
mon conclusion of the destructive reasoning whereby the apostle
has replied to the objections touching the law, from the 20th verse
of chap. v., up to this place 3 and it relates to the commencement
of obedience to the law in the renewed man. Of this obedience
the apostle here proposes himself as an example : for when he here
says—“ I myself,” this is not to be understood of him in particular,
but the meaning is—‘ I, or any one who, like me, has been re-
newed by the Spirit of God? The obedience of such an one he
thus sets forth in his own example by a contrast—‘ I serve the law
of God indeed, but I also serve the law of sin ;' that is—‘ I so
render obedience to the law, that 1 also transgressi the law, during
the whole of my life below: so that the obedience rendered to
the law is only begun, and but partially begun3 and that obedience
to the law is partial both in me, and in all who, like me, are rez-
newed. He iHustrates each member of the contrast by its cause,
obedience by “ the mind,” and transgression by “ the flesh ε· for
>“ the flesh,'’ or, ‘the remaining corruption of our nature, as the ’
apostle has previously argued in chap. vii. 7, and following verses, is
