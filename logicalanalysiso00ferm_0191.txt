‘ No one shall be able to condemn those for whom Christ inter-
cedes and acts as advocate in heaven with the Father3

⁴ But Christ interccdes and acts as advocate, in heaven with the
Father, for us who are elect, and for each of us:

⁴ Therefore no one shall be able to condemn us who are elect.'

35. “Who shall separate us from the love of Christ ?’' The

third part of the conclusion is in like manner amplified by ana-
coenosis, the interrogation of which, contained in verses 35, 36, is
twofold. The first interrogation is gencric and general, concerning
every adversary ⁴ tho shall separate us from the love of Christ ’θ’

⁴ that wherewith we love Christ our Saviour 3⁷ for although hypo-

himself should not love the elect, or that those who have been re-
deemed by him should not love him in return, from a powerful
sense in themselves of his love ?’ ⁴⁴ Shall tribulation, or distress‚
or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword ?” This
is the second and particular interrogation relating to those things
which, in particular, oppose themselves to the elect, and threaten
to separate them t from the love of Christ3 these are the manifold
affiictions and evils of this life, of which seven species are here
enumerated.
