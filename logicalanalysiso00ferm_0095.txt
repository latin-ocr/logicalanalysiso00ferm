EPISTLE OF PAUL TO THE ROMANS. 53

who perhaps perverted the authority of J ames in support of it,—
that. Abraham was justified by works. The apostle—agreeing
with J ames, that Abraham was justified by works, and had where-
of to glory, namely, because, as J ames says, he had offered his
son upon the altar—replies,—·‘ that nevertheless this glorying of
Abraham was not before God, but before men : ⁷ that is—that by
the effect of saith alluded to, his righteousness was proved, nay,

righteousness ε
. ‘ Therefore he was justified by saith?

, The argument is taken from what equally follows in the case of

justifiedfrom saith? The assumption is contained in this verse,
' proved by the authority of Scripture and the Divine testimony3

Gen. xv. 6 ; Ps. cvi. 31. ’

4. “ But to him that worketh the reward is not imputed from
grace, but from debt.” He here proves the proposition of the
foregoing syllogism :—

. , ‘ To him that worketh the reward is from debt 3
