314 LOGICAL ANALYsls OF THE

performance of duty, yet the argument tacitly binds the strong
likewise to perform their duty to the weaker3 for if God has re-
ceived the strong, why should not they also receive the weaker‘?

4. “ Who art thou that condemnest the servant of another ‘?''
The second argument is from disparates :—

‘ No man should condemn the servant of another 3

‘ But he that eats everything is God’s servant, and not yours
who, from weakness of faith, eat herbs:

⁴ Therefore you who do not eat, should not condemn him who
eats!

“ To his own master he Standeth or falleth.'' This is the rea-
son of the proposition, or why the servant of another is not to be

shall not be condemned by his own master, but justified? “ For
God is able to establish him.” This is the reason of the epanor-
thosis, from the ability of God :—

‘ God is able to establish him: ⁷

⁴ Therefore he shall be established.’

But you will say that the argument stom ‘ being able’ to ‘be-
ing,’ is not valid. I answer—that that is true, except when justice
demands ‘ being? for, if it be granted that any one ouylzt tozdo
such a thing, the argument from ‘ being able’ to ⁴ being,’ and that
he wilc perform that which he is able to perform, is valid, if he be
just. Although‚ therefore, God ie, and can be a debtor to no crea-
