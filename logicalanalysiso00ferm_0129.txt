EPISTLE OF PAUL ΤΟ THE ROMANs. ’ 87

from the end of our mortification or crucifixion with Christ. This
end is twofold : the first is—‘ that the body of sin may be destroy-
ed ς’ the second—‘ that we may no longer serve sin ε’ “ our old
man, says the apostle, is crucified with Christ, that the body of sin
may be destroyed, that henceforth we may not serve sin.'’ The
expression— “ old man’' is used by the apostle to denote ‘ our
nature is so far as we are old, and bear the image of the first Adam,'
that is in so far as we are corrupt, so that “our old man” is ‘our
corrupt nature,’ or ‘ the corruption of our nature ς’ and. it is de-
nominated cc the old man '' in respect of ‘⁴ the new creature,’' or the
subsequent sanctification of our nature through Christ the second
Adam, which is styled our ‘⁶ new⁷' and ‘⁴ inward man :⁹⁹ the ex-

then in ourselves ε in him ; because like our other sins, it was im-
puted to him and along with “the hand-writing of ordinances
which was contrary to us” was fastened by him to his cross, that
it might not be an obstacle in the way of our life 3 andin us, whilst
by his spirit, which he procured for us on the cross, he slays our
corruption, that being raised again we may live unto God. Con-
cerning the latter mode of crucifying, the apostle appeals to our
own knowledge, as concerning things of which a Christian man
ought not to be ignorant.

7, 8. “For he that is dead is free from sin? This is the pro-
position of the leading syllogism :——‘ he, therefore, who is dead to
sin, is truly set free from sin, that he may not continue in sin,' or
‘ under its dominion‚' as the apostle afterwards speaks. Or if you

prefer to understand these words of Christ, and ἀποθανών of him as
dead, or “ the first-born of the dead,’' this will be a third argu-
ment for the proposition, from the effect of the death of Christ,
which is—the complete liberation from sin, both of himself as our
