EP1s'rLE OF PAUL To THE ROMANs. 321

11. “ For it is written, I live, saith the Lord.'’ He further
establishes the assumption by the testimony of the Holy spirit,
announced by Isaiah, (chap. xlv. ver. 23). The ⁴ bowing of the
knee' betokens———‘ the subjection of him who bows the knee, due
to him to whom he bows it 3' and ‘ the confession of the mouth’—
ι the acknowledgment by him, who bows the knee, of that subjec-
tion.' By this testimony of the prophet, therefore, he teaches these
two things z—(l.) ‘ that all are to be subjected to Christ the
judge3 (2.) that all, even the most ungodly themselves, shall be
forced to acknowledge that subjection to be just and legitimate.

12. The second argument is taken from ourselves, or from the
account which each of us shall give to the judge, for himself, when
we shall all stand before the judgment-seat of Christ ; and the
apostle thus reasons :-— ἡ

‘ Whosoever is to give an account of himself when he stands be·-
fore the judgment-seat, should not judge another before the time,
but should be solicitous, in time, how he shall answer concerning
himself 3

‘ But we are all, every one of us, to give an account of ourselves·
when we stand before the judgment-seat of Christ :

‘ Therefore, none of us should judge another before the time,
⁵ but every one should rather be solicitous, in time, how he shall
answer to the judge concerning himself?

“ So then, every one of us shall give an account of himself to
God.” This is the assumption of the syllogism.

13. “ Let us no longer, therefore, judge one anotheffl——is the con-

clusion. Thus far the injunction concerning the ⁶ reception of weak .

brethr'en? Next comes the second, about—‘ not putting a cause of
offenee in the way of those who have⁴ been received ;’ which is
illustrated by a finite *⁵ effect, and amplified by a rhetorical correc-
tion illustrated by a comparison of majority. “But'’ is the note of
correction and contrast; “ rather”—the note of the comparison
