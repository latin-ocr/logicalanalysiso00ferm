122 LOGICAL ANALYSIS OF THE

and corrupt as he now is, is not subject to the law of God’—this
assumption being amplified by a comparison of minority—‘ not only
is the wisdom of man not subject, but it cannot indeed be subject
to the divine law 3’ whence the foregoing assumption follows con-
cluded—

‘ Therefore the wisdom of the flesh is enmity against God.'

8. “ Therefore they that are in the flesh cannot please God.‘’
Last of all comes the conclusion of the second branch of the proof,
viz.—‘ that freedom from condemnation belongs not to those who
walk after the flesh.’ The terms of the conclusion are however chang-
, ed3 for ⁶ to be in the flesh’ is put instead of ‘ to walk after the flesh,
the cause, namely‚ for the effect, as we have before pointed out3
and likewise ⁴ the displeasure of God’ instead of ‘the condemna-
tion of carnal man‚' which is also a metonymy of the cause for the
effect 3 for in the anger and displeasure of God, the condemnation
of those who do not please God is certain. This is the way in
which I explain the passage. But it may also be said that there
is in these words a second argument for this second branch of the
proof‚ (viz.-—‘ that freedom from condemnation belongs not to
those who walk after the flesh,’) the argument being taken from
the disparate of that freedom, thus 3-

Freedom from condemnation belongs not to those who do not
please God, or who are under the wrath of God, and are, as the
apostle calls them, “children of wrath ;''

‘ But those who are in the flesh not only do not please God, but
are not even able to please him’-so this assumption is stated in
the verse before us, amplified by a comparison of minority t whence
follows the conclusion-—

‘ Therefore those who are in the flesh, or walk aster the flesh, are
to be condemned, nor does the freedom which is here announced
belong to them?

9. “But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit.'' Thus far the
proof of the proposition, and the first section of the chapter. N ext³
