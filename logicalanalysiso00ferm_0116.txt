74 LOGICAL ANALYSIS oF THE

for as his life works out salvation for us, so it is through him that
we glory in salvation until we attain it. “ Through whom we have
now attained the reconciliation.” He illustrates this effect of
Christ in working out glorying for us, by a similar previous effect
of the same Lord J esus Christ, which was—-‘ to work out recon-
ciliation for us.'

12. ‘4 Therefore, as through one man sin entered into the world,
and death through sin.'’ We come now to the conclusion of the
point in dispute, and of the principal question which has been dis-
cussed from the 18th verse of chap. i. to this place, viz—that that
righteousness by which man is justified in the sight of God, is
through one man J esus Christ (the same who is God-man),* appre-
hended by fait-h. This conclusion is here variously amplified, by
a twofold comparison between Christ and Adam3 whence Christ
is called ‘⁴ the second Adam,'' or, as the apostle speaks in lst Cor.
xv. 47, “the second man.’'

The first comparison is one of similarity, which is stated in two
ways : lst, Explained by its parts: 2d, Abridged. The protasis
of the explained similitude is contained in these words, “ through
one man,'’ that is, ‘the first man,' or, ‘Adam,' “sin and death
entered into the world.'’ The apodosis, which is understood, runs
thus :—-—‘ So through one man, namely, the second man, or, J esus
Christ, was righteousness, and life through righteousness came to
the world? ‘⁴ And so death passed upon all men, in that all have
sinned.'’ An illustration of the protasis from the adjunct of the
universality of sin, and of death because of sin :—‘ death has come
upon all men, because all have sinned.’ For whether you under-
stand this of individual men of the race of Adam singly, or of al]
men in Adam jointly, taken either way, it is an universal truth—
v‘ that all have become subject to death, because all have become
subject to sin :' for all sinned and died in Adam, and all since
Adam sin and die, except Christ, the second Adam, who alone
*being without sin in himself, *died for our sins.
