crifice afterwards to be offered to God, among all nations by new
obedience and giving of thanks, (Mal. i. 11.) By ‘⁶ bodies,'’ accor-
dingly, in this proposition, we are to understand by synecdoche——

·‘ the whole man, composed of body and soulz’ for as Christ redeems,

and reconciles to the F ather the whole man, and sanctifies the
whole man by his Spirit, (1 Thes. v. 23); so man should present,
not only his body, but his entire person as a sacrifice to God, by
blameless living. The apostle, therefore, here puts onc constituent
of man for the entire man, a part for the whole 3 and he thus
speaks, because, although it is from the heart that what either de-
files a man, or proves him pure, proceeds, according as it is writ-
ten—‘⁶ out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh,’' and
elsewhere—that thefts, murders, fornications, and whatever defiles
a man, ‘⁶ proceed from the heart ;'’ yet it is in the actions of the
body especially, as being openly subjugated to the bodily eyes,
that God is either glorified, or his name exposed to reproach.
‘⁴ Living,’' this is the third part of the verse, wherein he proceeds
to amplify the proposition of the exhortation thus defended by its
arguments3 and this he does in two ways: first, by the adjuncts
of the qualities of the sacrifice to be offered3 and, secondly, by a
definition of this offering, whereby we present our bodies a sacri-
fice to God. The adjuncts of the qualities of the sacrifice are
three: first, the sacrifice which we offer to God must be—“ liv-

ing? then—“ holy;’' thirdly—“ acceptable.” By the first of these

qualities this sacrifice of Christians is distinguished from that
of animals under the law: for the beasts which were offered were
slain, and consequently were dead sacrifices3 but the apostle
exhorts us so to offer ourselves to God‚ that we may be alive
when offered.

The same quality distinguishes the eucharistie sacrifice of our
new obedienee, from the propitiatory sacrifice of Christ: for he
offered himself to God- as a ransom, * and as the price of our re-
demption by death3 but, as regards us, the apostle bids us offer
ourselves as a living sacrifice to God. Moreover, by the ‘life’
