innocent.’ He therefore eorrects his profession of j oy by the desire
which remained and continued with him, that the subject-matter
of his joy from them should continue3 and this he comprises in
two particulars 1--“ wisdom‚’' and “ innocenoe.'' Each of these
the apostle illustrates, and in a manner defines, by their subjects:
he requires “ wisdom'’ in ‘⁶ what is good ;’' “ innocence (from guilt)’'
in “what is evil.'' If, therefore, you wish to define them: “ wis-
dom” is—‘ the science of walking with God in that which is good ς’
while “ innocence” is—‘ freedom from the deeds and guilt of those
who walk in that which is evil ε’ bot-h of which definitions the
apostle elsewhere expresses in a few words, when he recommends

to the Church ‘ to walk in the spirit,' and ⁴ not to care for the lusts
of the flesh, so as to fulfil them’ (chap. viii. 1 3 xiii. 14).»

which consists of two parts: the one being a request against an

may the Grod of peace bruise Satan under your feet shortly.'' The
enemy he denominates—-“ Satan ;'' and in the single mention of him,
he includes all the enemies of the Church: for all who annoy the
Church are—either Satan himself, or his emissaries 3 as appears from
the first denunciation of spiritual war, in which it is said that ‘ the
“ serpent,’ and f the seed of the serpent,' are those, and all those, who
should be enemies to, or indulge enmity against that particular
‘ woman,’ namely, the Church of God, and ‘ her seed,’ both the first-
bom, and the rest in him. The first request therefore is :--‘ may
God tread and put under your feet, the serpent and his seed, viz„
Satan, and all who, being his emissaries, are your enemies.’ 'This
request is founded on the promise made to the first-born of the
woman—“ sit thou on my right hand, until I make thine enemies β
- thy footstool ;’' which promise the apostle here extends, in the
