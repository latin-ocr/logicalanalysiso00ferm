Hezekiah and J osiah. In this way the meaning will be—‘ that the
Gentiles having been added, through the gospel, to the people of
God, that is, to the Israelites, who are Israelites in spirit, as well
as according to the flesh, “ all Israel,” viz., Israel in spirit, consist-

the apostle confirms by scripture authorities, to teach us ‘ that,
in the matter of religion, all other arguments that may be adduced
go for nothing, unless both the arguments themselves, and the
conclusion deduced from them, be based on the written word of
God 3’ so that in theology ‘ God himself has said’ (ἀυτὸς ἓφη)
holds the place of a first principle, which does not admit of being
