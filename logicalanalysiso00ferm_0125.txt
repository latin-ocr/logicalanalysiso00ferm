EPISTLE OF PAUL ΤΟ ΤῙΙΕ ROMANS. 83

an objection arising from the preceding epanorthosis is antici-
pated :—·

⁴ If grace superabounds where sin is augmented, we must con-
tinue in sin that grace may thence the more abound 3

‘ But you, Paul, assert, that where sin is augmented grace
superabounds :

‘ Therefore we who believe on Christ must continue in sin that
grace may thence be augmented the more.’

This conclusion, as being manifestly absurd, the opponents do
not venture to draw, and, therefore, instead of stating it directly,
they put it in the form of a question, insinuating both that the
conclusion follows from the apostle's teaching, and that the doc-
trine of the righteousness of saith leaves us at full liberty to in-
dulge in every vice.

2. “ Far from it.'' To this question the apostle returns a two-
fold reply. First, he repudiates the conclusion of the objectors,
as impious z—-‘ far be it from us who believe in Christ to continue
in sin; and far be it stom me to say or to teach this, or that it
should be capable of being deduced from what I teach.' “ How shall
we, that are dead unto sin, live any longer therein.'' This is the
apostle’s second reply to the quest-ion, whereby he proves that the
believer on Christ must not continue in sin. The first argument is
from privative opposites :—

‘ Those who are dead to sin should not live in sin3

‘ But we are dead to sin:

‘ Therefore we should not live in sin?

The assumption and conclusion are contained in the words
quoted. Upon these words observe first, that ‘ to live in sin’ and
‘ to continue in sin' are synonymous, and that ‘ to die unto sin’ is
the opposite of both. Observe again that the sin here in question
is the remaining corruption of our nature after Christ is known and
the new life is begun: for those who are born again are only par-
tially regenerat-,ed during the present life, so that the remains of
original corruption—which the apostle, in Gai. v. 17, denominates
