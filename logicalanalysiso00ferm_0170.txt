which proposition, along with that of the omitted assumption, are
given in the two following verses, 15 and 16, where each is esta-
blished by two arguments.

15. “ For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again unto
fear, but the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, (i. e.) Fa-
ther.” The first argument is taken from the nature of the spirit
by which we are led: it is ⁶ the spirit of adoption? “ Adoption,’'
moreover, is ζ the affiliation or reception into the dignity of sons
of those who formerly were not sons :' “ the spirit of adoption,''
therefore, is that spirit which seals adoption, or the dignity of sons
of God bestowed in Christ, God’s only Son, on those who were by
nature “the children of wrath.’' This argument is to be adapted
to the proof of the proposition in this way :—

‘ As many as are led by the spirit of adoption are the sons of
God,’ as is obvious from what we have just said concerning
adoption;

‘ But the Spirit of God is the spirit of adoption ε

is not the spirit of bondage, but the spirit of adoption-⁹ Eaeh
member of this contrast is explained by its effect ; bondage, indeed,
by ‘fear,’ but adoption by ⁴ an inward cry in the hearts of believers,
whereby’ he shows that ‘ they call upon God as their Abba, οι-
Father: ·’ the proposition is thus proved by these words, The
proof of the supposed assumption is tacitly implied 1n the words,
“ ye have received? in. this way: —- “ “

, ⁴ All those who have received the Spirit of God, or of adoption,
are led by the Spirit of God or of adoption;

‘ But you,’ says the apostle to the believing Romans, ‘ have re-
ceived the Spirit of adoption and of God:

‘ Therefore, you are led by the Spirit of God,' which was the
assumption of the foregoing syllogism-
