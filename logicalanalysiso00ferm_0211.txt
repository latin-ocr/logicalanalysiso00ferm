thence bestowed upon us, are from God, and not from ourselves.’
And the grace itself is explained by a distribution of the whole
into its parts, which are—⁴ to will' and to perform ς’ the whole, or
if you prefer it, the genus being—‘ the grace of God who shews
mercy, conferred on us wretched!

17. ‘⁴ For the Scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Ι have raised thee
up for this very purpose.’' This is the second testimony, whereby
the apostle proves, from the example of Pharaoh, that the rejection
of the ungodly is in like manner subject to the will ancl providence
of God as its first cause, and that prior, as has been already said of
Esau, to all the evil deeds of the reprobate. The chain of causes,
therefore, is this z—God, according to his most free and just will,
rejects3 the wicked man, being rejected, acts wickedly3 whence
follows his most justly merited condemnation. ‘⁴ I have raised
thee up,” the Lord says concerning Pharaoh, or ‘ caused thee to
stand 3' that is, ζ Ι have both preserved thee from the beginning on
purpose for judgment, even from conception that thou mightest be
born, and with the same purpose I have, with much long-suffering,
endured thee still acting wickedly, after the many plagues which I
sent: so that, by this one word, it is indicated that Pharaoh was
both made and preserved by God, or according to the most free
will of God, as a vessel of wrath. Lest there should appear to be
any injustice in this raising up of Pharaoh, and his preservation
even whilst acting wickedly, inasmuch as it is an effect of God and
proceeded from the wffl of God, this deed of God is illustrated
by its twofold end, each unexceptionably good. “ That I may
shew my power in thee.’' The first end is—‘ the display of the
power of God both to Pharaoh himself, who was ignorant of it
(Exod. v. 2), and to all men everywhere, in most justly punish-
ing him? “ And that my name may be declared throughout
the whole earth.” The second end is—‘ the praising of God
and glorifying of his name by all the inhabitants of the earth,

in consequence of the display of his power in the case of
Pharaoh.’
