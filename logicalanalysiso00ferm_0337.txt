tion concerning the duty of inferiors to superiors3 and that, by.
reasoning from what equally follows in the case of relative oppo-
sites, thus :-—-

‘ Inferiors should perform the duty which they owe to their su-
periors3 and superiors‚ in their turn, the duty which they owe to
their inferiore ε

‘ Therefore‚ for an equal reason, equals ought to render to equals,
and all to all, the duty which they owe?

“ To whom tribute is due, tribute :⁵⁹ Next comes a twofold illus-
tration of this common injunction. The first is drawn from an in-
duction of the duties which one owes to another3 but an incom-
plete induction, consisting of four particulars only, without pero-
ration. Of these, the three first are borrowed from the foregoing
discussion, and contain duties to be performed by inferiors, to their
presidents and superiore: for it is the duty of inferiors ζ to render
tribute? The same may be said also of—“ custom,’' and “ fear :³⁹
for it is the part of inferiors to fear their superiors 3 and wherever this
order is inverted‚ there we see duty inverted and. devilish. Thus,
in the days of Christ, the ecclesiastical presidents of the Jews
would have said—that the baptism of John the Baptist- was “ of
men ;” but were withheld from saying it by fear of the people. In
like manner, they would have apprehended Christ at the feast of
the passover, yet, having assembled the council, they resolved not
to do it3 and the reason is assigned—‘⁶ lest there should be a
tumult among the people :'' they feared, therefore, to seize our
Lord openly, because they were afraid for themselves, of the people,
who were their inferiors 3 an inverted fear, which shews that they
had forsaken the path of duty: for had they not been “ foolish
shepherds,” whose ‘ right arm was dried up, and their right eye
⁴utterly darkened' (Zech. :zo-that is, had they not departed from
duty—instead of their having had to fear the people, the people
would have had to be afraid of them. “ To whom honour, honour-'⁹
*This is the fourth particular in the induction, and unlike the three
preceding: for as the preceding particulare of the induetion con·-
-tained a duty to be. performed by all to their ,superiors3 so this
