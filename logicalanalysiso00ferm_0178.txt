are waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God, from the pain
and sorrow of created things, consequent upon their condition
before described3 the excess of this pain being illustrated by the
similitudes of one sighing audibly, and of 0110 111 travail: then by
the adjunct of the time, and its constant duration: ‘ Created
things sigh, and are like a travailing woman, who anxiously longs
for the period of her delivery, even unto the time of the revelation

Thus far we have had the common testimony of created things
concerning the glory—to be revealed—of the sons of God. Next
comes the proof of the second testimony, which is that of renewed
man, or, as the apostle here speaks, ‘ of man having the first

the Holy spirit, whose perfection 01 full harvest will follow, in
another life, to all those who receive the first fruits in this? This
second testimony to the glory to be revealed is in like manner
proved by the effects of the renewed, which are here set forth
under a comparison of majority :— ’-

‘ Not only other creatures, but even we ourselves who have been
renewed, wait and sigh in hope of the glory that is to be revealed -:

‘ Therefore we ourselves also are witnesses that it is to be re-
vealed ε’
