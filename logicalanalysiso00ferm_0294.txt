with which they served him under the law3 the one being externa]
and confined to stated places, times, and carnal ceremonies, but
the other internal, in spirit and in truth. This difference, our
Lord points out (John iv. 20, 21, 22, 23,) in his reasoning with
the Samaritan woman, when she proposes to him a question of
controversy betwixt the Samaritans and the Jews, along with the
arguments on either side. The Samaritans said that God ought
to be served on Mount Gerizzim, the Jews, at J erusalem3 this
was the controversy ε the argument of the former was—‘ that there
their fathers served God3' of the latter—⁴ that according to the
law, it was necessary so to worship him‚’ (Deut. xii. 16, compared
with 2 Sam. xxiv. 18, in the former of which passages, God’s
people are commanded to serve him in that place which J ehovah
should choose for himself out of all the tribes of Israel3 and in the
latter, he makes choice of the thrashing-floor of Araunah the J ebu-

woman, and justifying the Jews thus far in that controversy,
shews that the distinction betwixt the divine service from that
time forward, and the service of former times, would be this,
namely-—‘ that hitherto it was necessary that God should be
served at Jerusalem, as the Jews said 3 but that thereafter a time
should come, yea, then was,'—by which he means ‘under the
gospel’—‘ in which the service of ⁴ God should not be restricted
either to the Samaritan mountain, or to Jerusalem, but when those
who served God should serve him in spirit and in truth, wherever
theypleased! The apostle, therefore, here calls this service of
God in spirit and in truth, without any restrictiori of place—“ the
reasonable service ;’' the whole of.which he says is included in
the offering whereby every Christian offers himself as a sacrifice
to J ehovah.
