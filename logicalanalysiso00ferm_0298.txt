mind, whereby we are conformed to God, and created again, after
his image, in righteousness and true holiness3 the other, in our
transformation,÷¹÷ whereby we are made unlike to this age, and ab-
stain from the ways of this world, and of that life which is accord-
ing to ‘the prince who has the power of the air,' as the apostle
speaks, Eph. ii. 2.

“In order that ye may prove.’' We have here the end of each
of the foregoing—both of our transfiguration, whereby we are
made unlike to the world in our life, and of our renewal, (ἀνακαι-
νώσεως Τθῦ νθός,) whereby we are made new ereatures3 for we are
both renewed and separated from the world for this end—‘ that
we may prove what is the will of God.’ By “the will of God,”
here, Ι understand—‘ his will as made known in the law concern-
ing the new obedience of the renewed 3' for so the apostle explains
it in 1 Thess. iv. 1, 2, where, after reminding them of the com-

spiritual grace, as the apostle himself speaks in 1 Cor. iv. 7. “ To
prove'' (τὸ δοκιμάζειν) that will of God signifies three things.
First, it is-—‘ to understand' (συνιέναι) God’s will, that is, both to
know what it is, and to be able to distinguish it from every thing
which is thrust upon us, under the pretext of its being God's will,
when it is not that will, as the apostle interprets this word in
Eph. v. 17. Secondly, ‘⁴ to prove'' (τό δοκιμάζειν) the will of God
is—‘ to approve it when understood ς’ and, in the third place, it is
·—-‘ to choose, or embrace, it when approved 3’ for even the sensual

man (o ψυχικός) both understands the will of God, and will ap- , „
