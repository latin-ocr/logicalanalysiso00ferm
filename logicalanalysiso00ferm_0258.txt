216 LOGICAL ANALYSIS oF THE

⁴ But the former—viz„ that the Israelites have stumbled for that
fourfold end—is true : ‘ Therefore they are to be recalled.'

The proposition is omitted as obvious3 the assumption consists.
in an enumeration in verses 11 and 12, of the ends for which the
Jews were given over to their own counsel, so as to stumble against
Christ the author of their salvation. ‘⁴ VVhether have they stumbled,
ο][·--α whether therefore have they stumbled‚” Sec. The first end
is here illustrated by a contrast :—-‘ the Jews have not stumbled
against Christ that they should fall away from God 3 but that
through their fall salvation might come to the Gentiles.’ “Far
from it.” He proves the arsis and first member of the contrast by
his own effect, in devoutly expressing his aversion to, and abhor-
rence of the falling away of the J ews—‘ May God avert so great
a judgment from his people‚ as that the Jews should stumble
against Christ for this end, to fall away from God 3’ whence what
is here expressed in the Greek idiom, by the words—‘⁴ far from it”
(μῆ γένοιτο), is in the Syriae version expressed by a form of

prayer—‘⁴ Do thou spare :⁹⁹ this is also the commencement of the ’

hypophora or subjoined reply, in rhetorical consultation 3 which re—
ply consists of two parts, of which this expression of aversion to so
great a judgment is the first. “ But through their fall,” &c- This
is the thesis and second member of the contrast‚ wherein we have
the true and positive end for which the Jews stumbled against
Christ3 and it is at the same time the second part of the hypo-
phora or subjoined reply to the question—‘⁴ Whether‚” 800„ at- the
beginning of the verse, “To provoke them to emulation.'' This
is the second end for which the Jews stumbled against Christ,
namely—‘ that by the Gentiles drawing near to God in Christ, and
believing the Gospel, the Jews might be moved to anger and pro-
Ἴ voked to emulation, for a recompense‚ and. that God might recom-

pense * their iniquity‚ in moving to anger the God of their salvation,
by their idolatry and vanities ;’ see Deut. xxxii. 21,--“ they have
moved me to jealousy by those things which are not the mighty

(God) 3 they have· provoked me by their vanities z I also will move -’
