EPISTLE or PAUL To THE RoMANS. 235

taken away their sins, and above all, the sin of hardening and ree·
jection of Christ? The' meaning of both passages, therefore, is
this, ‘ Although now that Israel is hardened, the apostle might
say, as he says in Acts xiii. 46,—“ We turn to the Gentiles,'’ and
preach Christ unto them for the remission of sins, yet it will come
to pass at length, namely, when the fulness of the Gentiles shall
have been brought in, that all Israel shall receive Christ, so that
they also shall become partakers, as the Gentiles have become, of
the remission of sins in Christ3 and when this shall have taken
place, the covenant of God in Christ shall then be with Israel, as
it now is with the Gentiles. That this is the meaning appears to
be proved by the most explicit language of the apostle in 2 Cor.
iii. 15, 16, where, speaking of Israel in his own age, he says,——

vail was upon their hearts at the time when he was preaching, to
wit, that. an opportunity might thus be afforded for the bringing
in of the Gentiles 3' (2dly,) ‘that the Israelites would afterwards
at length turn to the Lord, at which time their hardening should
cease, and the vail be taken away?

. 28. “ (Therefore),” Sec. This is a corollary, subjoined to the
last conclusion concerning the future recal of Israel to the God of
their salvation, in order that the apostle may thereby check the
triumphing of the Gentiles over the Israelites, against which he
has spoken· at great length proleptically in the course of the fore-
going discussion, viz‚ in the 17th and following verses ε as, there-
fore, in the two preceding verses, the conclusion was ‘ that all
Israel are to be recalled to the God of their salvation ;' so in this
verse, the apostle would conclude ‘ that the Gentiles ought not
to glory against Israel, 'not even during the· present time of har-
· dening itself.' The corollary consists of two parts. “ As regards
the gospel, ,they are enemies for your sakes.” In this, which is
