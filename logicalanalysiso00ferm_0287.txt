ledgment, whereby the apostle, in the name of every member of
the Church, signifies his approbation of the glory which he has
proclaimed, as most justly ascribed, and to be ascribed for ever, to

his God.

CHAPTER XII.

Thus far we have had the first part of this isagoge to the truth
in Christ,* and compendium of the Christian religion, in the com-
mendation of the gospel and proof of the proposition-‘ that the
gospel is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believ-
eth? In this proof the apostle has discussed two things: first—
‘that righteousness whereby man is justified before God 3' and
secondly—‘ the life which follows thereupon? And he has rea-
soned concerning each in two ways, both constructively and
destructively: concerning righteousness——‘ that it is through the
saith of the gospeL' he has reasoned from the 18th verse of chap. i.
to the 20th verse of chap. v. ; from which place up to the commence-
ment of the 8th chapter he has replied to all objections whatever,
drawn from the law, which could be adduced against the righteous-
ness of saith: in chap. viii. again, he has reasoned concerning the
full persuasion of life, and the certainty of escaping condemnation,
which in its beginning at least, is possessed by all who are justified
through the saith of the gospe13 and has replied to the objections
against that way of life, taken from the people of the law, or Israel,
according to the flesh, from the commeneement of chap. ix, up to
this place, or the commencet‘nent of the 12th chap. Now follows
in order, the second part of this isagoge, which wholly consists in an

’ exhortation to a life worthy of the gospel, or such as befits him

who is righteous, and looks for life from the righteousness of saith,
that is, God's righteousness in J esus Christ.-
