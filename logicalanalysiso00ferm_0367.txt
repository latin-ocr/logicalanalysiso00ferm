EPISTLE oF PAUL To THE ROMANs. 325

argument for the injunction, from the subject-matter of the king-
dom of God, set forth proleptically, and by contrast : for the strong
might say :—‘ we must hold fast the ‘liberty of the kingdom of God,
whatever be the consequence3 nor are we to be vstopped by the*
destruction of any, or by our good being evil spoken of, but must
consider what the liberty of the kingdom of God demands, so that
God, our Lord and King, may be glorified in the use of our liberty.'
To this objection the apostle replies by arsis and thesis, shewing :—
‘ that the kingdom of God does not consist in the things in ques-
tion, viz., in meat, drink, and other things indifferent,9 that is,
‘that the service of God is neither attended to by attention to
these things, nor neglected by the neglect of these things, considered
in themselves3 but that the service of God, whereby it becomes
known that God is our King, and we his kingdom, consists in
righteousneSS, peace, and the joy of the spirit? By “ righteous-
ness” I understand—both ζ imputed' and ⁴ inherent righteousness τ’
·for we serve God, and God reigns in us, through faith, by which
we lay hold of God’s righteousness—that is, righteousness imputed
through faith in Christ—unto salvation3 and new obedience, whereby
we grow daily in inherent righteousness, as the effect of righteous-
ness imputed, until we be also perfected, and completely renewed
after the image of God. By “peace'' I understand—‘ that sere-
nity of a pacified conscience which 'flows from⁴ the imputation of
Christ's righteousness3' and I further understand by the term
⁷ f‘ peace'’ here—“ the desire, as far as in us lies, of being at peace
with all men? The “joy of the Spirit'’ is the effect of both, viz„
'of the “righteousness'' and the “peace’' And the kingdom of
-God is said ‘to consist in' 'these things, because it is from these
things that it becomes known that God is our King, and we his
'redeemed. Such is 'the‘ way in which the apostle replies to the
prolepsis. The argument hence drawn for the establishment of
:the injunction, is as follows ε- ’ ’ .
· ζ If ¹the kingdom of God, or that service whereby it becomes
known that God reigns in us, -does not consist in meat, food and
drink, and other things indifferent, these things indifferent· are
