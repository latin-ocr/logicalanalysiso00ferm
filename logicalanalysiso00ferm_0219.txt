EPISTLE OF PAUL TO THE ROMANS. 177

suppose, those who are Israelites according to the flesh, but we
who believe on Christ and are the called of God, whether from
among the Jews or from among the Gentiles ε

‘ Therefore,’ the apostle might say to his opponents, ‘ although
Israel according to the flesh reject the salvation which Ι announce,
yet it does not follow that it is not the true way of salvation, see-
ing that the whole people of God, namely, all the called from
among Jews and Gentiles, embrace it.’

25. (ζ As he also saith in Hosea, I will call that my people
which was not my people 3 and her beloved, who was not beloved.

26. ‘⁶ And it shall come to pass, that in the place where it had
been said unto them, Ye are not my people, there shall they be
called the children of the living God.'’ He proves the antecedent
part by part, but by hysterosis 3 for he proves that first which
was last in the distribution, viZ.—‘ the calling of the Gentiles, and
that all, even from among the Gentiles who believe on Christ, are
the called of God, or of the number of his people and true mem-
bers of his Church. The argument by which it is established is
drawn from testimony, and that twofold, both taken from the pro-
phet Hosea, the one from chap. iii. 23—“ I will call that my
people which was not my people 3 and her belove'd, who was not
beloved :'’ the other from chap. i. 101-ss And it shall come to
pass, that in the place where it had been said unto them, Ye are
not my people, there shall they be called the children of the living
God.'' As it is allowed by the common consent of all that both
these testimonies are to be accomplished in the reign of Christ,
and in the gathering again of the Church under him, so, according
to the interpretation of the apostle, here they are each to be taken
not only of the gathering again of the Israelites who were rejected
in the carrying away by Shalmaneser, but also of the Gentiles who
were rejected at the building of Babel, remnants, through saith,
from among both of whom are, according to the prediction of the
prophet, to be gathered again under the reign of Christ.
