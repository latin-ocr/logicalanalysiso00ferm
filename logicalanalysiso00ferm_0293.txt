EPISTLE or imm To THE Roemxs. ‘251

pure: [for so we learn from] Tit. i. 15, where, when the apostle
has said, that—“to the defiled (μεμιασμένοις) there is nothing purc,⁷'
but that, “ both their mind and conscience are defiled,'' he further
defines those whom he denominates ‘⁴ defiled,⁷’ as ‘⁴ unbelievers,'’ *'
i.e., ‘ all who are not engrafted into Christ J esus through genuine
saith ς’ therefore, it is because those who are not- engrafted into
Christ J esus, as well as whatsoever is offered by them are defiled,
that neit-her they themselves, nor the gift which they offer, are ac-
cepted, as the prophet speaks. Although, therefore, that accept-
ableness, or the third quality of the Christian sacrifice, whereby it
becomes “ acceptable to God,’' follows the two preceding, whereby
the apostle commands that it be “ living” and “ holy ;'' yet—inas-
much as neither our new life, nor our begun sanctification can
stand before God, on account of the imperfectiori of both, unless
covered by Jesus Christ and his perfection-—that acceptableness
is, properly speaking, the effect, neither of the life, nor of the holi-
ness which has been begun within us, but of Christ apprehended
by us through faith3 therefore, it is not because this sacrifice of
Christians, namely, life and begun sanctification, is living and holy,
that it is acceptable unto God 3 but it is because whoever is endued
with new life and true holiness is in Christ, that both the life and
holiness, and the gift itself, are acceptable.

“ Which is your reasonable service.’' This is the second ampli-
fication of the sacrifice to be offered by Christians‚ taken from a
definition of that sacrifice: if you ask—what is the sacrifice of the
*people of God under the gospel, or of Christians? it is—‘ the reae
sonable service of God’s people, or of Christiane? In this defini-
tion‚ “ your service,'’ or ‘ the service of the people of God‚' is the
common genus, denoting-‘ the duty to God to be performed by
God's people, according to both tables of the law, from the very
beginning of the world, on to its very end :' and in calling that

’ service (λατξὲιαν) “the reasonable” (τῆν moruch), he lays down
the difference‚ whereby the service of the people of God, with which
they serve him now under the gospel, is distinguished from that
