EPISTLE OF PAUL To THE ROMANS. 367

being ‘⁴ beloved by the apostle,’' he is, moreover, “ the first-fruits to
Christ in Achaia,’' that is—-‘ the first in Achaia who embraced the

--‘ beloved by the apostle;’ and the cause of that love is—‘ his
Ι participation in the' Lord in common with the apostle.’

9. Urbanus and stachys aare saluted in the sixth place3 and both
