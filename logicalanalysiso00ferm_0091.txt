Eris'rLE oi«- PAUL To THE RoMAxs. 49

argument the apostle, with a view to confirm his conclusion, adds
the expressions from faith, through faith, as an exposition or ex-
planation of thc effect of God in justifiving Jews and Gentiles, the
Justification of both having this in common, that it is effected by
faitlt. It will be observed that there is a distinction made between
the two cases by the mode of speaking employed 3 for the apostle
says that the circumcision, ele. the Jews, are justified from saith,
but that the Gentiles are justified throuqlz faith. This distinction
I conceive is to be explained as follows :—First, the apostle inti-
ma-tes to the Jews ‘that although they have the law, yet the mat-
ter * of righteousness in their case is not the law and the keeping
of it, but that saith, or Christ apprehended by faith, is the matter
of righteousness before God even to those who possess the law 3'
or, as he expresses it more plainly in Gal. ii. lsi—‘⁶ we also believe

on J esus Christ that we may be justified from the faith of Christ, ,»

and not from the works of the law,’' that is, ⁶ that Christ, not the
law, may be the matter of righteousness to us :' ,this is the one side
of the distinction. As regards the other, when he says that the
uncircumcision is justified throuyh faith, he points out the form†
through which righteousness becomes ours, and whereby Christ
himself alsovis apprehended by faith 3 so that the meaning is—
‘ As Christ, and not the keeping of the law is the matter of right-
eousness to the Jews who have the law, so the way to the same
righteousness lies open even to the Gentiles themselves, who have
not had the law, through the same Lord J esus Christ apprehended
by saith ς’ as was foreseen and predicted long before by N oah, when
he blessed J aphet, Gen. ix. The apostle introduces this distinc—
tion here that the Jews may not deceive themselves by thinking,
because they have the law and circumcision, that they will be jus-
tified from the law and circumcision3 but that, carried beyond
these, they may, through the same faith, lay hold of that right-
eousness which is common to them with the Gentiles, who could
not hope for salvation from the ‘law and circumcision, inasmuch as
they had not the law.
