EPISTLE OF PAUL TO THE ROMANS. 75

13. “For until the law, sin was in the world.” This is a pro-
lepsis, whereby he anticipates an objection of the Jews7 excusing
sin by carnal reasoning, or, if you prefer it, of the sensual and
natural man acquitting the first age of the world on the ground
of the want of the law, thus :—

( Where there is no law there is no sin3

‘But there was no law in the world until Moses3 for the law
was ordained through Moses:

‘ Therefore, there was no sin in the world from Adam to Moses 3
and what you teach, viz.‚—that all have sinned, is not true.' To
this objection, the apostle replies, that there were both law and
sin in the world before Moses: accordingly, he first proves that
there was law, and then that there was sin. He proves that there
was law in the world, because there was sin, and so turns the rea-
soning of the objectors against themselves, thus :—‘ VVhere there
is sin, there is law3

‘But there was sin in the world before Moses and the law or-
dained by him :

‘ Therefore, there was also law before the law which was ordained

by Moses?

The assumption is given first. “ But it is considered that there
is no sin where there is no laW.'’ This is the proof of the proposi-
tion, viz.—‘ that where there is sin, there is law? The argument
is taken stom what equally follows in the case of relative opposites ;
for if it is considered that there is no sin where there is no law, it
follows, that where there is sin, there is also law, because, of a truth,
“ sin is the transgression of the law.''

14. “But death reigned from Adam until Moses.” He here
proves the assumption of the last syllogism, viZ.-‘ that there was
sinin the world before the time of Moses? The argument is drawn
ftom the effect and wages of sin, which are death :—

‘ There was death from Adam to Moses :

‘ Therefore there was also sin? . ”

. , For as there is no sin where there is no law, so there is no death
