EPISTLE OF PAUL TO THE ROMANS. 179

of God are those who believe, not only from among the Jews, but
also from among the Gentiles3 and the conclusion, like the proof,
consists of two parts. In the first he makes reference to the first
part of the proof, and from the testimonies cited out of Hosea,
infers—‘ Therefore, the Gentiles have apprehended righteousness.'
This conclusion the apostle presses by anacoenosis—‘ what shall we
say ‘?’ He also amplifies it by two considerations. The first is from
the disparate of the Gentiles obtaining righteousness z—-‘ the Gen-
tiles who were not following after righteousness have obtained it.'
The second consideration by which it is amplified is a definition
of the righteousness which the Gentiles have obtained 3 which the
apostle here defines by its genus, it is ‘ righteousness 3’ and by its
instrumental cause, or, if you please—since here, as throughout
the writings of this apostle faith, by metonymy of the adjunct for
the subject, may be taken for ζ Christ apprehended by faith’—by
its instrumental cause and subject at the same time 3 the right-
eousness, therefore, which the Gentiles have apprehended is—
‘ the righteousness of J esus Christ whom they have apprehended

by saith!

> 31. “ But that Israel, who were following after the law of right-

eousness, have not reached the law of righteousness.” This is
the second part of the conclusion concerning the rejection of the
multitude of the Jews and Israelitish people-——“ Israel,” that is
‘ the body or multitude of that people,' “have not reached the
law of righteousness ;'' and it is amplified by a contrast—‘ al-
though they were following after the law of righteousness, yet
· have they not reached the law of right'eousness! By “the law of
righteousness’' here I understand—‘ the fulfilment of the law,' or
⁴ that righteousness which the law demands 3’ for he that fulfils
the law is said to “ reach the law.”

32. “ Wherefore ⁴? because not from faith, but as if from the
works of the law.'' ,The reason of the latter part of the conclusion,
§md why Israeldid not reach the law of righteousness, is taken
