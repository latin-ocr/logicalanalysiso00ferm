sion, or in uncircumcision ?” As he had interrupted the question
by interposing the ground of it he repeats it a second time.
‘⁴ Not in circumcision7 but in uncircumcision.” This is a hypo-
phora, or the subjoined reply‚ of which there are two parts. Of
these the first consists is a contrast—-‘ faith was imputed to Abrae

Abraham, which he had when in uncircumcision.‘” This is an epan-
orthosis, in which the apostle corrects what he has just said, viz.—

‘ that Abraham is the father of the circumcised,’ by a contrast :— .

‘ Abraham vis not the father of all who are circumcised, but of
some,' whom the apostle here describes by a comparison of majo-
