xviii LIFE OF FERME.

to house, is known to the whole north. T hrough his industry, and
by the divine blessing, such a light blazed forth that even children
could render an admirable account of their faith, and that not
without some feeling of piety ..... Α Tydeus in body he was a
Hercules in spirit.'’ The sword, however, proved too sharp for its
scabbard, bruised and battered as the latter had been by ill usage
on the part of others. Worn out with study, broken by incessant
toil and frequent sufferings, he expired on the 24th of September
1617. His remains were buried in the old Church of Philorth.*
Adamson says, that he left behind him “various monuments of
his genius,” and specifies, besides the work of which a translation
is contained in the present volume, another, entitled Lectiones in
Esterem; both of which he recovered through the means of Wil-
liam Rires, “a learned youth, and minister of the word,” as he
styles him. The Logical Analysis of the Epistle to the Romans
was written by Ferme during his residence at Fraserburgh, in con-
sequence, Adamson tells US, of a request made to him by certain
ministers and probationers. The manuscript lay for many years
in the north, “ as it were, buried with the author.'' After a
lengthened search, Adamson at length procured it, and caused it
to be printed at Edinburgh, where it was published in a small
octavo volume in 1651. It was his intention to issue the Prelec-
tions on Esther very soon after the publication of the work on the
Romans3 but this he did not live to accomplish. I am not aware
that any copy of this exists3 the other productions of Ferme’s pen

have certainly perished.
