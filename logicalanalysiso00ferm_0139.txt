EPISTLE OF PAUL ΤΟ THE ROMANS. 97

unto death. The protasis is illustrated by its causes: the one is
—‘ the flesh,' or ‘our corrupt nature3' the other—‘ the sinful
affections,’ or ‘ motions of sin in our members prevailing through

the provoking of the flesh.'

6. “ But now we are free from the law, that being dead wherein
we were held, that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in
the oldness of the letter.'⁷ We have here the conclusion of the
leading syllogism and apodosis of the last similitude—⁶ We are not
under the law.' This is illustrated, lst, by its cause, which is—
‘ the mortification of sin, whereby we are held under the dominion
of the law 3’ 2dl3s, by the adjunct of the manner, set forth in a way

of contrast—-“ in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the
letter.’'

7. “ What shall we say therefore Ρ Is the law sin ?” Thus far
we have-,had three objections touching the use of the law, and the
first division of the refiitation, from the 20th verse of chap. v. up
to this place. Next comes the second division of the refutation,
relating to the essence of the law, in which the topic discussed is,
—-‘ whether the law of God be in itself essentially evil and sin——
or rather that sin sinful-and itself the origin of all sin and death ε’

this constitutes the second section of the chapter, and the second
ι principal objection relating to the law. This objection like the
last is not directly deduced, but instead of stating it in the form
of a conclusion it is turned into a question,-—‘ Is the law sin ?' by
which, however, it is implied, that the conclusion itself,—‘ the law
is sin'———is a consequence from what the apostle has been previously
teaching,--“ Far from it.’' The reply to this second objection
follows, consisting of three parts. First, he replies by expressing
his abliorrence of such blasphemy, and denying the consequence—
‘ far beit that so blasphemous an assertion should follow from my
teaching‚ as that the law of God is either evil or sin? For so, I
take it, the expression—“ far from it,” is here to be understood,
’ as if he had said—‘ far be it from us to say ;’ for he refers to that
