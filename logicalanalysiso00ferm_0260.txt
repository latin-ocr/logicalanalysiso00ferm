‘I honour my ministry, to try if, by any means, I may provoke
my kinsmen to emulation, and may save some of them :

‘ Therefore‚ the Israelites have stumbled for these ends.’'

“In that Ι speak to you,’' 820. The words inclosed within this
parenthesis are a prolepsis, of two parts, whereby the effect of Paul
in discharging his ministry is explained: first, it is shewn how
Paul honours his ministry 3 and then how that ministry which he
honours can be said to be his. In regard to the former, he says—
‘ I honour my ministry in this that I say these things to you Gen-
tiles,’ that is, ‘inasmuch as I assert that the Jews have stumbled
for the salvation of you Gentiles, in order that they being moved
to emulate you, may return to the God of their salvation.’ As re-
gards the other, he says,-‘ I call this ministry mine, because, as
an apostle, I have been sent by the Lord to the Gentiles?

14. “To try if by any means,’' &Q We have here the two
ends on account of which Paul honours his ministry, illustrated by
the adjunctos their difficulty. The first end is——‘ the provoking
of his kinsmen to emulation 3’ the second, which, having been
previously omitted, is here expressed——‘ the salvation of some of
them through that emulation.' The difficulty of both is expressed
by his saying—“ if by any means I may provoke,’' or ⁴ may be
able to provoke.’

15. “For if the casting away,’' &c. This is the conclusion,
illustrated by a similitude, and proved by reasoning from the less
to the greater. The conclusion relating to the reception of the
Jews is illustrated from the like—⁴ it will be, as it were, a resur-
rection of the dead: for by that type the prophet has illustrated
their restoration from Babylon (Ezek. xxxvii. 13) and in the same
way the apostle here illustrates their restoration from unbelief *
and the power of Satan, which also 1s Babylonian bondage m a
spiritual sense. The conclusion thus illustrated, is proved, as
above, from the less, m the following way: -
