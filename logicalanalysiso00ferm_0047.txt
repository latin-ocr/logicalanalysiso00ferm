EPISTLE OF PAUL TO THE ROMANs. 5

you all? ‘⁴ That your saith is announced throughout the whole
world.'’ This is the third and last particular, and the [occasional]
cause of Paul’s thanksgiving, viz., the saith of the Romans3 ί Ι
give thanks to God concerning you all,' says the apostle, ⁴ and
your saith is the occasion ς’ which saith is explained by the adjunct
of its announcement and the subject place of the same3 viz,
“ throughout the whole world.” By “ faith’' 1 here understand
their piety towards God, and profession of the doctrine of faith
in word and deed.

9. ‘⁶ For God is my witness ;” the second argument for gaining
their good will, and the second thing done by Paul, viz., ‘ the in—
creasing mention made by him of the Romans 3’ which I conceive is
to be understood not merely of the giving of thanks, for that goes
before, nor of the prayers, for these follow after, but still more of the
anxious zeal and zealous anxiety of Paul in inquiring, on every
occasion, into the state and condition of the Romans as it respected
God and the gospel of Christ. Hence it would appear that, imme-
diately he has said that the faith of the Romans was announced
throughout the whole world-—that is, was reported to him by every
one in whatever part of the world he might ha-ppen to be; it is
by way of accounting for this that he immediately subjoins—
“ For God is my witness that I make mention of you ;'' as if in-
timating the reason why that saith of the Romans should be an-
nounced to him more than to any other person, namely, because he
made mention of them, and enquired concerning their state more

frequently than others. Moreover he assures them that he thus ·

made mention of them, by an appeal to Deity, and describes
God, as the witness of his anxiety, by the adjunct of his own ser-
vice3 ‘⁴ For Grod is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in
the gospel of his son.'' This service again is amplified. by two par-
ticulars: the first of which is the adjunct of the manner of serving
“with my spirit;” that is, ‘ cheerfully, with my whole soul, and
unfeignedly ;' the second is taken from the subject of his service:
, “ (1 serve him) in the gospel.''
