EPISTLE OF PAUL TO THE ROMANS. 35

void the faith of God ?'’ This is the third objection of the Jews,
also suggested by the foregoing reply3 for they attempt to remove
the prerogative of grace through the promises, that they may re-
tain their own, namely, either that the J ew has no advantage, or
that he has those which they have specified ς in a word, the Jews,
by this objection, endeavour to set aside the instance of the
apostle, and reason thus :—‘ All did not believe the oracles and
promises of God,'——which the apostle admits in the beginning of
the 3d verse—‘ therefore no advantage belongs to the Jew nor to
circumcisionss Their argument, stated at length, would be as
follows :—

‘ The advantage of being a J ew, and of circumcision, ought to
be universal and common to all?

But all have not had the oracles and promises of God committed
to them, (the proof of this being—that all did not believe, which,
as has been said, the apostle admits.)

‘ Therefore, neither is this prerogative common to all, and con-
sequently it is no prerogative.' The apostle replies to the proof
of the assumption, and shews that it does not follow, because some
do not believe that the oracles of God were not committed to them
according to the word of his promise 3—-‘ for in that case the un-
belief of some would render void the saith of God 3 but the latter
cannot be? The assumption * is comprised in the question and
subjoined answer of the apostle—“ Shall their unbelief make void
the faith of God? the answer is—“ far from it :'’ he denies with

’ abhorrence that the faith of God can be nullified by the unbelief

of some of the Jews ; whence he draws the conclusion that it does
not follow that the oracles of God were not committed to these
persons, because they themselves did not believe.· By this the
V apostle teaches us two things 3 first, that the oracles of God have
been committed, (that is, the word of the gospel and the signs of
it have been given,) even to hypocrites in the visible Church3
secondly, that in order to our becoming partakers of grace there is

thetical syllogism.)
