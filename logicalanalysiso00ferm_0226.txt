God and his worship, we are angry at, and hate as an enemy
whatever seems to obstruet that worship and glory, or threatens
to deprive us of God or of his worship, is called-‘⁶ a zeal of God.”
The apostle, therefore, here bears witness concerning the Israel-
ites, that they loved God and his glory so intensely as to be trans-
ported with vehement hatred against any thing which threatened
to deprive them of God, or to prove injurious to his worship.
‘⁴ But not according to knowledge.’' He illustrates the zeal of
the people of Israel by a contrast—“ they have a zeal of God, but
not according to knowledge.'' This is not to be understood as if
the Israelites had no understanding, or were absolutely ignorant
of that with the zeal of which they were affected, as the Papists
in the present day build their devotion on ignorance and implicit
saith 3 for the Israelites were acquainted with the traditione which
they had received from the fathers, and were affected with zeal in
their conversation, according to these traditions (Ma-tt. xv. 3 3
Gal. i. 14) ε βοῒ, inasmuch as that conversation was “ vain,’' as the
apostle Peter terms it, (lst Epis. i. 18‚) the apostle here calls
their knowledge of these traditions, according to which they lived,
‘ ignorance3’ the true knowledge of the worship of God being
founded on the sacred word of God alone. The knowledge, there-
fore, which the apostle here denies to Israel, is a knowledge of the
word of God and of his will, as revealed in his written word. For
although they possessed that word, (seeing that “ to them were
committed the oracles of Gody) and God's revealed will concern-
ing his own worship and the righteousness of man, yet neither the
people, nor their teachers themselves, understood either the word
of God, or his will as therein revealed3 whence Christ in the
Gospel frequently both calls and convicts them of being—‘⁴ blind
guides,’' who neither, on account of their ignorance, entered them-
selves, nor suffered others to enter into the kingdom of heaven,
Thus while Nicodemus, a teacher in Israel, is being instructed by
Christ, he shews that he is ignorant even of the new birth, (πα-
λιγγενεσίας) which is the entrance into the kingdom of heaven3
and the rest of the Phar-ieme, although they knew from the< word
