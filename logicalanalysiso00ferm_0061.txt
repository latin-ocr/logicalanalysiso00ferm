world ;’' and again, in 1 Cor. xi. 8, “the princes of this world.''
The apostle charges these persons—who boasted of their knowledge
of God, and vaunted themselves as the teachers of others, and the
reprovers of unrighteousness and ungodliness in others—with
being themselves guilty of ungodliness and unrighteousness, and
also with holding the knowledge of the truth in unrighteousness.
Of this subdivision the proposition is, ‘⁴ Oh, man! whosoever
thou art that judgest (another),'’ in which words the apostle de-
scribes the censorious and moral philosophers among the Gentiles,
by their effecting, judging, and accusing others of sin, in order
that they themselves might be esteemed the more holy. ‘⁶ (Even)
thou (thyself) art inexcusable3’' that is, ‘thy knowledge of the
truth of God has its own end in thy just condemnation,’ or, ‘so
as to render thee inexcusable When God judgeth thee,’ as the

apostle has before said3 chap. i. 20.

1. “ Wherefore thou art inexcusable, oh man Ῐ whosoever thou
art, that judgest others.’' The first argument in support of his
proposition is deduced from the foregone conclusion, by which the
apostle has concluded, that the Gentiles in general, knowing the
judgment of— God, yet did things contrary theret03 and therefore,
that proposition is enunciated illatively, and as a sort of secondary
conclusion—“ leerefore thou art inexcusable,'' &e.; “ for, in the
act of judging another thou condemnest thyself.’' The argument
runs thus 2—-

Whosoever condemns himself vin the aet of judging another is
inexcusable:

“ (But) thou, O man,'' says the apostle, addressing the Gentile

Ι philosophers individually, ‘⁴ in the act of judging another, eon-
demnest thyself ;'’
, “ Therefore thou art inexcusable.” The proposition is awanting3
but the other two part-s of the syllogism are given in the verse,
only that the assumption, by hysterosis, is placed after the conclu-
* sion, “Thou that judgest another doest the same things.” He
; ⁸ proves the assumption by an argument drawn from the effecte of
