EPISTLE 01⁷ PAUL To THE ROMANS. 85

into death.” This is the conclusion of the last, as it was also the
assumption of the leading syllogism, viz.—‘ that we are dead to
sin? This death is ί illustrat-ed by its principal efficient cause,
J esus Christ, and by his death—⁴ we are buried with him into
death,' i. e., ‘ buried by the power and efficacy of his death ς’ be-
cause, as has been stated, the Holy Spirit, who mortifies us to sin,
with Christ, is procured for us by the death of Christ. Then by
its instrumental cause—‘⁴ through baptism ;” for baptism, just as
the whole ministration of the word and sacraments, is not only a
sign, but, through the operation of the Holy spirit, is the instru-
menvt to believers of producing mortification in them. It must be
remarked, however, that the apostle does not say—we are ‘ dead,'
but “ buried'’ with him3 whereby he would teach us that we are
dead to sin in such a way, that we ought to die more and more
every day: for burial is the continued progress of death begun.
“ That like as Christ was raised up from the dead to the glory of
the Father, so we also should walk in a new life.’' This is a third
illustration of our burial with Christ, taken from its end, which end
is ‘ to walk in a new life ς’ that is, as the apostle speaks in Eph. iv.
l,--‘ to walk worthy of the calling wherewith we are called,' or—
‘ to live in a manner worthy of the gospel.' This, the end of our
spiritual burial, is here illustrated by a similitude :—As Christ was
raised up from the dead to the glory of the Father: so we, having
been buried to sin and raised again to newness of life, ought to
walk in that new life: Our first resurrection, or resurrection to a
new life, is here compared by the apostle to the resurrection of
Christ, not on account of their similarity merely, but because the
resurrection of Christ is the efficient cause of our resurrection to a
new life 3 inasmuch as Christ when he rose again, and ascended to
heaven, sent down the Spirit by whom we are renewed, as he pro-
mised to do, John xvi. Notice again here, that our spiritual mor-
tification, or that mortification whereby we become dead to sin, has
reference to our walk in a new life3 whence it foHows that besides
the mortification of sin, which goes before and resembles burial,
⁴ there is another part of our regeneration, viz., the raising again or
