’198 LOGICAL ANALYSIS or THE

is here treated of3 nor does the apostle bind or confine God’s ex-
traordinary operation to ordinary means, such as the sending of
preachers, and the hearing of the word preached,) so that that saith
which is built upon tradition apart from the word, and the faith of
those who despise preaehing is no faith at all; 3dly‚ That he who,
as the apostle speaks, “ desireth the office of a bishop,’' or applies
himself to the preaching of the word of saith, must attend first of
all to the sending of God, and inward calling, since no man will
preach as he ought, unless he has been sent by God, and inwardly
called. “ As it is written, How beautiful are the feet of those
that preaeh the gospel of peace, that preach the gos-pel of good
things 1³⁹ Next comes the assumption, in the rest of the l5th, and
whole of the 16th verses, consisting of two parts3 the first is—
‘ We, the apostles, have been sent by God to preach the word of
saith 3' the second—⁶ the Israelites do not believe, but reject us
who have been sent to preach the gospeL’ The first part is itself
omitted, but is here proved from the testimony of the prophet
concerning the apostles who were to be sent to preach the gos-
pel, and their reception by the elect only. Although rejected by
the world of those that perish, yet, to the elect, the prophet in
these words predicts that the expected heralds of the gospel
would come from God‚ so that, to them, their feet should be
beautiful.

16. “ But they have not all obeyed the gospe13 for Isaiah saith,
Lord, who hath believed our report ⁸?’' , We have, in these words,
the second part of the assumption—‘ but the Israelites do not be-
lieve us who have been sent from God to preach the gospel :’ thi-
is both itself expressed in the text, and the proof of it added from
the testimony of the prophet, Isa. liii. 1, where, being about to
'foretell the sufferings of the Son of God, and the glory that should
follow, the prophet not only complains of the unbelief of his own
age, but also presents to view the future difference among the
{Israelites under the reign of Christ, and the full revelation of the

gospel.
