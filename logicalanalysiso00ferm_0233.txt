EPISTLE OF PAUL To THE ROMANS. 191

his beart, is righteous, and being justified by‘faith shall live? This
description is presented by the apostle in the form of a dialogue t
for he first of all asks what Moses says concerning the righteous-
ness of saith, ἐφη, 111 what manner and in what words he describes
that righteousness3 then, as it were with the consent of his op*-
ponents, he subjoins the reply—that Moses says concerning the
righteousness of saith, to you who seek righteousness by saith that
“ the word is near thee, in thy mouth and in thy heart,’' as much
as to say—4 if you have the word in your mouth and in your heart,
¹you are righteous by saith, and shall live, shall live by saith? The
apostle, therefore, thus proves the-latter part of the antecedent :—
’ ‘ If J esus Christ, being sent from heaven by the Father, both died
for us and rose again from the dead, freely and without exertion on
our part, so that every one who has the word in his heart and in his
mouth, being justified through him, shall be saved, it follows, that the
righteousness of saith is not like the righteousness of the law, im-

seek it’—this, which is the proposition, is omitted as obvious ε

‘ But the former is trud—this, which is the assumption, is given

the righteousness of saith is near at hand to, and sreely obtained by
all who believe, and who seek righteousness and life from saith.

In this way we may collect the argument of the passage 3 or, if
you prefer it, the arsis or first member of the contrast being omit-
ted, more concisely, thus :—

‘ If every one is justified by saith who has the word in his mouth
and in his heart, righteousness is near at hand and easy through
grace 3 ‘But the former is true z ‘ Therefore the latter is true?
“ That is, the word of saith which we preach.'' He next explains
the latter member of the contrast, or the affirmative description os
the righteousness of saith 3 which description consists 'of two parts:
for, first os all, in the remainder of the verse he shews what is this
‘⁴ word’' os which Moses speaks3 and then in verse 9, what it is
‘to have this word 111 our mouth and in?0u1: heart. As regards tlie
