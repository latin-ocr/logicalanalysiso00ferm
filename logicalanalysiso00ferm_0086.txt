44 LOGICAL ANALYSIS or THE

common to all who believe, both Jews and Gentiles, without dis-
tinction.’

This already consummat-ed effect is the fall into sin, with its
consequences: whence, we may here observe, that according to
the mind of the apostle, the common fall of all men, although in
other respects pernicious, yet in respect of God, has been the me-
dium of the accomplishment by Christ of the common salvation of
all who believe.

24. ‘⁶ (That is,) by his grace.’' He next explains what it is to
be justified freely, viz. :—‘ that it is to be justified purely from the
grace of God, without any merit of our own? “ Through the ‘re-

his explanation, and defines what it is to be justified by the grace
of God, namely :—-‘ that it is to be justified through the redemp-

although in respect of ourselves that justification is free, to the
praise of the mercy and grace of.God; yet it is at the same time
from the redemption which is through the full satisfaction of J esus
Christ, to the praise alike of the justice of God.

statements, viz. :—‘ that justification is free,' and ‘that God is
just in justifying us freely,' which together make up the sum of the
gospel—by a description of J esus Christ. The first part of the

μ description is his ‘⁶ propitiation,'' illustrated by its author, “ God,”
