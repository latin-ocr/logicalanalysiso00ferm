160 L0G1cAL ANALYSIS OF THE

hypothetical syllogism, viZ., that the way of righteousness and life
through saith on J esus Christ which he has announced to them,
should not be rejected 'by the Gentiles as not the true way, be-
cause the Jews reject it, and everywhere speak against Christ.
The negation itself of the consequence is indeed suppressed to
avoid offending the Jews, with that prudence which we have al-
ready seen manifested by the apostle in the first part of his reply3
but four reasons for the negation are adduced by the apostle. Of
these the first is here given at the close of ver. 53 the second in
the ssth and succeeding verses, as far as ver. 243 the third occupies
the remainder of this chapter 3 the fourth and last is contained in
the two following chapters, x. xi. The words in which the first
reason of the negation of the consequence are expressed are these
—-“ from whom, as regards the flesh, is Christ, who is above all,
God to be blessed for ever, Amen ;” whence the apostle thus rea-
sons :—- .

‘ J esus Christ, of whom ye say that he was descended from the
Jews, and who is from the Jews according to the flesh, through
whom I announce righteousness and life, is God to be blessed
above all for ever3 to which the elect of God say Amen:

‘Therefore, although the Jews reject this way of salvation‚ it
does not follow that it ought to be rejected as not the true way,
but, on the contrary, as I announce, that there is no condemnation
to those who are in Christ?

My reason for taking this view of the passage is the uniform
practice of the apostle, who never brings forward descriptione of
Christ unless such as are exceedingly apposite and subservient to
his present purpose z of this we had an example above, in the 25th

ver. of ehap. iv., where, in his discussion concerning righteousness v

through faith, he in like manner presented us with an apodictic
argument, when defining Christ from his death and glory, or glo-
rious resurrection3 so here the apostle thus reasons, in full syllo- ‘
gism, if you choose :- ‘ ’

‘ IfJ esus Christ, whom the Jews reject, be “ God to be blessed
above all for ever,” and if by believing on him the elect are saved,
