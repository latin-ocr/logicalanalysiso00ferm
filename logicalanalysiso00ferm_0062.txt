20 LoGICAL ANALrsis OF THE

him who thus judged another, which effectsare set forth under a
comparison of equality——He who does the same things for which
he judges another, in the act of judging another, condemns himself 3

‘But thou,' says the apostle to each of the Gentile philosophers,
‘ that judgest another doest the same things for which thou judgest
another3

ί Therefore, in the act ofjudging another thou condemnest thy-
self.’

The assumption is expressed in the words just quoted, which
form the last clause of this verse3 but, by hysterosis, the proposi-
tion, with its proof, is given in the two following verses3 the proof

“ in the second, and the proposition itself therefrom deduced in the

third.

truth.” The arguments of the proof are two. The first is taken
from the adjunct of the judgment of God :—“ The judgment of
God is according to truth,’' which the apostle confirms by our own
testimony, that is, by the testimony even of natural men (φυσικῶν
ἀνθρώπων) themselves ; “We know.'' To be “according to truth”
here signifies, to be without partiality.*

God judges “according to truth,’' or he is impartial† in his
judgment 3 ‘ Therefore whoever judges another, while he does the
same things himself, is equally inexcusable with him whom he

“ Against those who commit such things ;'' the second argu-

The object of the judgment of God, and the guiltyss in his sight,
are those who commit such things,'’ i. e. things unlawful,§ who· ‚
soever they be, whether reprovers or reproved3 therefore those
who, while judging others, commit the same things themselves,
are equally guilty with those whom they judge.
