288 LOGICAL ANALYSIS OF THE

obedience, should religiously and wisely distinguish between the·
‘ powevful one' and ‘ the power,' that is, the office of the superior, and·
the man himself who holds the office3 and that for the three fol-
lowing ends t—lst, That that which ought, according to the ordi-
nance, to be performed to such a power, should not be refused to
the superior himself 3 2dly, That the Christian should not surren-
der himself to be obedient to the man, although his superior, be-
yond what the power· and the ordinance of God demand ; so that
his obedienee may not be respect of persons (προσωποληψία,)
but a duty proceeding from a consciousness of the power having
been ordained by G0d3 3dly, That whenever obedience must be
refused because the powerful one exceeds the limits of his power
ordained by God, that refusal of obedience itself should yet be
made with consideration and respectfully, on account of the respect
which the Christian is bound to yield to the power with which the
powerful one—who enjoins beyond the limits of the power com-

mitted to him—is invested, and which he bears. “For there is no .

power,” &Q Next come the arguments for the injunction, which
are four in number ε the first is fr0m the efficient cause, in the re-
mainder of the lst, and the 2d verse 3 the second, from the effect
of the magistrate, that is, from his work, and the end of his work,
in verses 3 and 43 the third, from the necessity imposed, in verse
5 ; the fourth from the effect of those who are subject themselves,
in verse 6. The first argument runs thus :—

‘ The Christian ought not to resist the ordinance of God, or
that which is from God3

‘ But every power is from GodV:

‘ Therefore the Christian ought not to resist the power, but
submit himself to it? ⁴ Α

The injunction itself is, indeed, deduced as the conclusion, but
'ina negative form3 for it is the same thing whether you say—-
‘ that the Christian should be subject to every power,' or ‘ that he -
should resist‘no power? As to the other parts of the syllogism9
'the assumption is first given in the close of verse 1, being estas
blished by the cause, vim, the efficient cause, which iss—⁴ the ordi-
