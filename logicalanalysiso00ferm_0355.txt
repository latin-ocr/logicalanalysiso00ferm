3. “ Let not him that eateth, make light of him that cateth not.'’
N ext come the injunctions3 the first of which is given to the ‘⁴ be-
lieving‚” or ‘ strong in faith :'—-‘ that they should not make light of,
or despise, because of their weakness of faith, those who do not
eat? From this I would have you leam—that the despising of
weak brethren, whereby these weak brethren are made light of, is
contrary to that reception of the weaker, which he had enjoined
upon the stronger, in the first verse3 whence it follows, that that
reception, as has been already said, consists chiefly in a due regard
for our weak brethren. “ And let not him that cateth not, con-
demn him that cateth? This is the- second injunction appertain-
ing to the weak3 whence it follows, that the injunction laid down
in the first verse, although it expressly binds the strong in saith
only, yet, analogously and by consequence, relates also to the
weak in faith. Moreover, in making the duty of the weak to con-
sist in ‘not condemning,’ the apostle would teach us :—‘ that the
breach of duty in the weak consists in condemning the stronger3
and, consequently, that an arrogant condemnation, without reason, is
the ground of their not giving themselves up to be received by the
strong in faith, teaching them in gentleness, and from the word)
“For God hath received him.’' We have next the arguments for
the second injunction, and why he that does not eat should not
condemn him who eats3 from which the apostle wishes to teach us
—‘ that although it be a grievous sin to make light of weak breth-
ren, yet for the weaker to condemn the strong in saith, is a sin more
grievous stiU.' The arguments are two in number. The first is taken
from the effect of God :—

‘ Man should not condemn him who eats, and, in the exercise of
his Christian liberty, eats every thing, if God has received him,
that is, approved him in Christ apprehended by saith 3
> ‘ But God has received him who eats everything:

‘Therefore the weak in saith, who does not eat every thing,
should not condemn him who eats every thing?

· And here Ι would have you observe, in passing, that although
the apostle is 'reasoning expressly with the weak in saith, for the
