term of authority, and appropriate to the commander in an army,
or a general among his soldiers 3* and therefore Paul, having been
appointed as it were a general in the Christian war-fare, by his
Lord, to enjoin upon others their duty, speaks with celestial au-
thority, in accordance with the word of their common Lord. ‘⁴ I
command every one that is among you, through the grace which
has been given unto me.’' This is the reason whereby he shews
that that authority of his to command every one among them, is
not usurped but legitimate, as resting upon the grace of apostle-
ship which had been committed to him by God3 and whereby he
precludes all evil speaking on the part of the envious, if any should
be disposed to charge him with arrogance, while enjoining sobriety
in wisdom, therefore thus reasons 2-—

to, love one another. By the special again, I mean those which
are due, not simply, but on account of some special respect which
they have either to ourselves, or to our brethren3 for example-
‘.‘ to the pure all things,” now under the gospel, “ are pure,”>nor
are we forbidden by the law to eat any thing we please, but “ to
him that esteemeth any thing impure, to him it is impure,'' and he
is bound, in respect to his own estimation, not to eat thereof 3 also
in respect to another, as a weak brother (namely), lest he cause
him to offend3 according to the law, therefore, we are free to eat 3
but⁴ if any one eat without saith, or with cause of offence, -then to
eat is evil. The apost-le proceeds to treat of the injunctions of the
former class, from this ,place to. the 'commencement of chap. xiv.
These are twofold, answering to the twofold duty which, according
