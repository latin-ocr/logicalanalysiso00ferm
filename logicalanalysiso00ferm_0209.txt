EPISTLE OF PAUL To THE ROMANS. 167

being freely given to Jacob, but not likewise to Esau? The ob-
jection, therefore, runs thus :—
‘ He who gives unequal things to those who are equal is unjust:
‘But in your opinion,' the opponents might say, ‘ God gives
unequal things to those who are equal3 for he loves Jacob and
hates Esau, both being equal, and equally undeserving:
' ‘ What, therefore, shall we say? Is there unrighteousness with
God ⁴?' The conclusion alone is given in the text, in the com-
mencement of verse 14. “Far from it.’' The apostle first of all
replies to the conclusion, by expressing his abhorrence of its im-
pious blasphemy, at the close of the same 14th verse.

15. “For he saith to Moses, Ι will shew mercy to whom Ι shall
have shewn mercy, and I will have compassion on whom Ι shall
have had compassion.'' He next replies to the proposition—viz„
⁴ that speaking of God‚ he is unjust who gives unequal things
to those who are equal, bestows grace upon one, and rejects an-
other from grace, both being equally undeserving'—-by denying it3
and the reason for the negation is this, ‘ that God is most free to
determine concerning all his creatures according to his own will,
which, as it is most free, so it is most just, and, therefore, the rule
of all justice.' This the apostle here proves by the testimony of
Moses and the Old Testament Scriptures, and that twofold. The
first is concerning grace conferred, in verses 15, 16; the second
concerning rejection to judgment, verse 173 whence, in verse 18,
he concludes, that God is free to show mercy or to pardon, accord-
ing to his own will, and is in both most just. As regards the first,
then, the testimony itself is adduced out of Exod. xxxiii. 19, from
which the apostle proves, that the source of grace conferred is th'e
will of God, which is most free, without respect to our works, and
this he does as follows :—

‘ The Lord says to Moses—’mm “ I will shew grace from mercy
to whom I shall have shewn grace,” that is, ‘ to whom Ι, shall have
willed to shew grace,’ “ and I will have compassion on whom Ι
shall have had compassion,” that is, ‘on whom Ι shall have 'willed
