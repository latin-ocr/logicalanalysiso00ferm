EPISTLE or PAUL To THE ROMANS. 27

plies that, although they are without the written law, yet they
are not altogether without law, and that they, therefore, assume
what is not true. Accordingly, he here proves, that although the
Gentiles do not possess the written law, yet they are not without
law. The arguments by which he establishes his proposition are
two. The first is :—

Those who are a law unto themselves are not without law:

The Gentiles are a. law unto themselves ε

Therefore they are not without law.

The assumption is thus proved :—

Those who, having not the written law, do by nature the things
which are of the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto
themselves ε

But the Gentiles, having not the written law, do by nature the
things which are of the law ε

Wherefore they are a law unto themselves.

The assumption of the latter syllogism is first given, and then
the conclusion in the words—“ These having not the law, are a
law unto themselves.’⁷

15. “ As those who shew the work of the law written on their
hearts,'’—the second argument by which the apostle proves that
the Gentiles are not without law :—

Those, on whose hearts the work of the law is written, are not
without law:

But the work of the law is written on the hearts of the Gentiles:

“ Their conscience at the same time bearing witness 3 ’'--the as-
sumption is proved by an induction of the parts of the work of the
law written on their hearts: the parts are two; the 0110--ί the
testimony of conscience ς’ the other-——‘ the mutual accusing and
excusing of their thoughts.9

Thus far the objections, first of the Jews, and then of the Gen-
tiles, against his last argument, and the equity of the destrue-tion
of sinuers of both classes alike, have been removed.
