of Abraham into the children of the flesh, and the children of the
promise, (chap. ix. 7, 83) so he divides the Israelites into “the
elect,” and “those left.'' By “the elect ’' are intended—‘ 111050
whom, along with Jacob, before they were born, or had done any
thing good or bad, (chap. ix. 11, 12, 13,) [God] chose to be con-
formed to the image of his Son,' (chap. viii. 29 z) by “those left '’
he means—4 the reprobate, who, being without election, have been
left behind to sin and death.’ Observe again, that in the first
member of the distinction, the apostle does not say that ⁶ the elect
have,’ but that “the election has obtained it ;’' for such is the
force of the expression in the original, (ἡ δὲ ἐκλογὴ ἐπέτυχεν 1) and

become hardened in heart against every admonition whereby they
are invited to return to a better life. This is expressed by the
metaphorical 101111-ἒπωξώθησαν, “they have become callous ;” for
πωξος, 01· ‘ callus,' is a white, hard, dry substance, whereby broken
bones are united, which grows upon the body contrary to nature,
like hard skin, andis so hurtful to the joints or lungs, that they
become unfit for their natural motion: by the word ἒπωξῶθησαν,
therefore, something similar in the wicked Jews, whereby they be-
came so hardened, as to be unfitted for every motion of the life of
God, and for every good work, is intended.

8. “ According as it is written.'’ In the three following verses
he both proves and amplifies the latter member of the distinction,
