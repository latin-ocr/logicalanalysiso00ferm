eomes the second section, and the assumption of the first and lead-
ing syllogism, of which, as of the proposition, there are two parts,
the one being—‘ but ye are in Christ J esus ;’ the other—‘⁴ but ye
are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit,'' or ‘⁴ wall< not after the flesh,
but after the Spiriff’ Both of these parts are handled in this
second section of the chapter3 but, by hysterosis, the latter occu-
pies the first place from ver. 9 to ver. 14, and the former the
second place from ver. 14 to ver. 31. The latter part of the as-
sumption, therefore, is contained in this 9th verse, viz.———‘ you “ who
are at Rome, saints, called,” whether from among the Jews or
from among the Gentiles, you, I say, are not in the flesh ς’ that is,

but in thess spirim

‘But the Spirit of God dwells in you:

‘ Therefore you are not in the flesh, but in the spirit.

“But if any one have not the Spirit of Christ, he is not his.''
He proves the assumption which alone is given in the text, indi-
reotly, by what equally follows in the case ofcontradictories, thus 2——

‘ If any one have not the Spirit of Christ dwelling in him, he is
not Christ’s:

‘ Therefore, you who are Christ’s, have the spirit of Christ dwell-
ing in you?

10. “ Moreover, if Christ be in you, the body indeed is dead be-
cause of sin, but the Spirit is life because of righteousness”--the
second argument for the· assumption from the effect' of the in-
