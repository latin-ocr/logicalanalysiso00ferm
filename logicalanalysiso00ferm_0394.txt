352 LOGICAL ANALYSIS OF THE

Pau13 or it consists of two parts: first, he effecte that they should
believe the gospe13 then, that they should live in a manner worthy
of the gospel—both of which are included by the apostle under
the one head of ‘ obedience to Christ? “By words and deeds.''
Here follows a threefold illustration of the antecedent, or ⁴ the in-
ducing of the Gentiles to obedience.’ The first illustrationis taken
from the adjunct of the means, which, it is here intimated, was
threefold: for Paul induced the Gentiles to obedience, first—“ by
words ;” then—“ by deeds ;’' thirdly—“ by the power of the Holy
Spirit.'’ By “ words’' I understand—‘ the preaching of the gospeL'

explains the deeds by which he induced the Gentiles to obedience,
by their three adjuncts: they were-—“ signs ;’' they were———“ won-
ders ;'' and they were—effected “by power.” In calling them
“ signs,” he intimates—‘ that these works signified to the Gentiles
that God was with him3 that he was the messenger of God3 and
that the word of his preaching was the gospel of salvation (as is
acknowledged by the PythoneSS, Acts xvi. 17).’ They are called
‘⁶ wonders,” inasmuch as they were ‘ strange, unusual, and truly
miraculous’ In saying that they were “ (effected) by power,” he
would teach us—‘ that they were effected, not by the might of
man or of any creature, but of God alone, with this intent, that
they should sign and seal the preachingg' as Peter teaches, Acts
iii. 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, where he shews that the miraculous cure of
the lame man was effected by divine power, that it might be a
sign to confirm their preaching concerning Christ. ’ The “ deeds,’'
therefore, of which Paul here speaks, are—‘ the miracles wrought
through him among the Gentiles ς’ and these, by the peculiar might
and power of God, in confirmation of his ‘⁴ words,'’ or of ‘ the gos-
pel which he preached.’ “ By the power of the Spirit of Godet ’
