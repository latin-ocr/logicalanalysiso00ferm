EPISTLE OF PAUL ΤΟ THE ROMANS. 171

‘ T herefore, if God hardens whom he will, he should not be angry
with those who are hardened.'

20. “ Nay but, O man! Who art thou that repliest against God ?'’
The apostle now proceeds to answer the objection. In this answer
he neither recals his former conclusion, viz., ⁴ that God hardens
whom he will,' nor denies the antecedent of the foregoing enthy-
meme, via, ‘that no man can resist the will of God ς’ and, conse-
quently lays down as true these two propositione: first,—‘ that
the hardening of the reprobate is according to the will of God 3'
and, secondly,-—‘ that those whom God shall have willed to harden
shall not be able to resist his will, nor to avoid hardening.' These
two positions having been laid down, he replies to the hypothe-
tical proposition [of the syllogism], or consequent of the foregoing
enthymeme, not only by denying it as most false, but, besides, by
eheoking his blasphemous opponent for thus replying against God.
He therefore not only denies as most false, but condemns of blas-
phemy and replying against God, the proposition—⁶ that if God
hardens whom he will, he is unjustly angry with him who is har-
dened 3⁹ and proves both the falsehood and the blasphemy in suc· ’
cession3 but, by hysterosiS, first the blasphemy, and then the false-
hood. “ Shall the thing fashioned say to him that fashioned it, why
hast thou made me thus ?’' The argument by which he proves the
charge of blasphemy is taken from the like, or, if you please, from
the greater :—

‘ Even in human affairs, if the things fashioned shall say to him
that fashioned it—‘ why have you formed me in this manner ?’ it
will manifestly be guilty of replying and blasphemously opposing-
itself to the will of him that fashioned it. ⁴ But, O man! whoever
you man be, you are fashioned by God, and are the work of his
hands ; he is your creator, and it is by him that you were formed:
much more therefore do you reply against God, and by so geply-
ing are a blasphemer, when you unjustly find fault with that, what-
ever it may be, which clearly and manifestly appears to have been
done according to »the will of God:
