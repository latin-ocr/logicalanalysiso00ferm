48 LOGICAL ANALYsls oF THE

28. ‘⁴ We conclude, therefore, that a man is justified by faith
without the works of the law.'’ This is the conclusion of the first
syllogism, as has been observed on the 18th verse of chapter 1.-

‘ Therefore justification is from saith?

29. “Is he the God of the Jews only? Is he not also of the
Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles als0.”

This is a working out and explanation of the foregone conclu-
sion, from the adjunct of the universality of its subject: for inas-
much as he has said that man is justified by saith, he shews that
by ‘⁴ man'' he intends the Greek, and whosoever of the Gentiles
is of the saith of Christ, not less than the J ew and the Israelite3
and this he proves by two arguments. Of these, the first is taken
from the principal efficient cause of that righteousness which is
common to Gentiles and Jews, namely, that God who is the self-
same God of both. The apostle, therefore, thus argues :—‘ Of
whomsoever God, namely, the one true God of the Israelites, is
the God, to them also belongs God’s righteousness3 or all such
are justified by saith without the works of the law.

‘But he who is the God of the Jews is also the God of the
Gentiles ;’—which the apostle here proves in a dialogue with the
Jews claiming God as their’s alone—-

‘ Therefore that righteousness of God which is without the
works of the law, and. from the faith of J esus Christ, belongs

equally to Jews and Gentiles!

30. “Since it is one and the ,same God who shall justify ‘the
circumcision from faith,· and the uncircumcision through saith?
The second. argument is taken from the effect of Him who is
the God alike of Jews and Gentiles, which effect is to justify both ;JV
and the apostle thus reasons :——‘ God justifies both “the circumss
cision,'’ that is the Jews or Israelites‚ and “ the uncircmncision,’?
or Gentiles.

⁴ Therefore God's righteousness belongs to the Gentiles alem
or both the J ew and the Greek are justified by saith! In this*
