episi-121⁴: OF PAUL To THE ROMANS. 355

or contraries, these being here indicated by the terms ‘ hither,’ and
thither,' or ‘into those regions? But if we may be allowed to dis-
pose the argument in full syllogism, he reasons thus :—
. ‘ If Ι have no longer a place here, Ι must come thither to preach
the gospel ;

‘ But the former is true :

⁴ Therefore so is also the latter! ἡ

“ But now, having no longer a place in these regions.’' This, is
the assumption of the syllogism, or antecedent of the enthymeme.
By “ these regions,'' he means—⁴ all those, from Jerusalem and the
