reconciliation‚ and the blessed condition of those only who are
reconciled‚ and born of God: whether therefore it be peace of
conscience, or that freedom of speech* before God which is the
privilege of sonship, or that reconciliation with the creatures‚ of
which Isaiah speaks in chapter xi. and lxv„ I conceive all this, and
the happiness of men therein, to be included under the name of
“ peace towards G0d” in this place. It is called peace “towards

that is, of the blessed condition which our merciful God confers
upon us already reconciled and again received into grace, as-thc
same apostle teaches us in the commencement of each of his
epistles, comprising all the blessings which he supplicates from·
God for us, at one time under “ grace, mercy, and peace‚'' at
