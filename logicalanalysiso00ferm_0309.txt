EPISTLE OF PAUL To THE ROMANs. 267

though it is true that it is elsewhere employed in a narrower sense,
as in Eph. vi. 11. Διακονία here, taken in a wider acceptation,
comprehends all other duties in the Church of God besides the
office of teac-hing3 in this sense the term is also used in 1 Tim. iii.
8, &Q where, after he has shewn what sort. of persons “ bishops''
or ‘ those who teach in the Church' should be, he describes
“ deacons,'' that is, ‘ those who, though not teaching, have charge
in other ways in the Church of God ς’ as appears from his requir-
ing in the former that they be “ apt to teach,'' but not in the lat-
ter3 although it is true that the term διακονία, is found employed
in the New Testament, both in a wider sense for every office in
the Church, so as even to inc-lude the apostles, (2 Cor. iv. 1 ς) and
in a narrower sense for those who, neither teaching, nor watchjng

manner in this ease is-that he who has received the gift of pro—
phesying or of teaching should teach—“ according to the analogy’'
or proportion of faith.” By “ the analogy of faith’' here, we may
understand what he has before denominated—“ the measure of
faith,'' or even—‘ the articles of faith' collected out of the written
word, and comprised in that Confession of Faith which has been
received from the very commencement of the Christian Church,
and which, as being conformable to the teaching of the apostles, is
commonly called—the Apostles’ creed .· in whatever sense the term
be taken, the prophet is enjoined not to depart, in prophesying,
from the common foundations which he has understood with cer-
tainty from the word of God. ‘⁴ Both he that teacheth, in teach-
ing3 and he that exhorteth, in exhortation.'' He subdivides ‘ the
-prophet’ into ‘ the· teacher,’ properly so called, and ‘ the pastor:
(Eph. iv. 11 3) both of whom are bound, the one to teach, and the
other to seed the flock of Christ “ according to the proportion of
