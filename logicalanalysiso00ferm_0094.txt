52 LooicAL ANALYsls 01· Tm:

maining verses are occupied with the proof of the consequence: ori
this may be viewed as the general proposition of a complete
syllogism, if you prefer that form of argument, in this way 2——

4 The justification of Abraham was recorded as a precedent for
our justification after him ς’ 01· more plainly—‘ in whatever man-
ner Abraham was justified, in the same manner we, his posterity,
according to the spilit,a1e also to be justified3

‘ But Abraham w as not justified by w orks, but by faith: ‘ There-
fore so ale 110 also to be justified!

The assumption occupies the first place, extending, as we have
said, to v. 16 ; next comes the conclusion, thence to v. 23 3 lastly,
the proposition from v. 23. to the end: and these are the three
sections into which the chapter is divided, In the first section,
containing the assumption, there are three sub-divisions : there is

justified by works,’ in vv. 1, 23 then follows the second part
of the assmnption, viZ.—‘ that Abraham was justified by faith,’

by the evidence of the truth3 as if he had said—‘ shall we say that
Abraham found righteousness according to the flesh. 9 I do not say
so; neither can you?

2. “ For if Abraham were justified from works, he hath where-
of to glory, but not before, God.” This is an illustration by coni
trast, of the first part Qf the assumption, in which the apostle pro-
leptically refutes an opinion commonly received among the J ewa,
