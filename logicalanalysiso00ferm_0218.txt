176 LOGIGAL ANALYSIS or THE

⁴ But the latter is absurd, viz :—that every one should be un-,
certain of his own salvation ε

‘ Therefore, the opponents conclude, ‘the former must be false,
viz z—that all who shall be partakers of salvation have been pre-
destinated according to mercy.'

To this objection the apostle replies by denying the hypotheti-
cal proposition. The reason for the negation is as follows :—

‘ Since all whom God, according to mercy, has predestinated to
glory, he also effectually calls in time (for this is the second part
of our preparation for glory, which was begun before time, and
necessarily follows that preparation, (see chap. viii. 30), and since

more within our knowledge than the calling itselfl'

“ Namely us, not only from among the Jews, but also from

subject set forth by a comparison of majority: and this, as we
have already noticed, is the third reason for the second reply of

the apostle to the leading objection in this refutation. The reason -

is to the following effect :—‘ The people of God are not, ayant
