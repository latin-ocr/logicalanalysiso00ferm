ungodliness with its just recompense,’ as the apostle afterwards
speaks, (verse 27.)

25. “ As those who changed the truth of God into a lie.⁷’ The
other and primary cause, or the reason for which God, as a most
just judge, had abandoned them to their own affectione, was their
own previous sin—‘⁶ they changed the truth of God into a lie,”

against nature.” This is first explained by distributing the sub-
