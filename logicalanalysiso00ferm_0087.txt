EPISTLE OF PAUL TO THE ROMANS. 45

understand the incarnation * of the Son of God, or his manifesta-
tion in the flesh. The second part is our reconciliation with God
through his sacrifice in the flesh3 for to be a propitiation is to be
a propitiatory† sacrifice, propitiating God towards us sinners: and
this is amplified by the instrumental cause whereby that sacrifice
becomes ours for reconciliation, which is—“ saith in his blood.''
The third part of the description is the end of each of the preced-
ing—viz„ of the incarnation and sacrifice in his flesh———which is
the display of God's righteousness—“ to declare his righteousness.”
By “ God’s righteousness'' Ι understand here, as above, in verse
21, that righteousness whereby we ‘are righteous in God’s sight,
which the apostle here defines by its form, as he has before de-
fined it in verse 22, by its efficient cause and subject. Its form is

“ the remission of sins.'’ These sins the apostle describes by their ’

former reign in the world3 for to be past here signifies that the
world had lived in them, and that they had reigned in the world
before Christ was known: so that the sense of the expression——
“which are past ’' is—‘ in which the world walked, and which
reigned in the world before Christ was manifested in the flesh 3 '
as the apostle himself explains it in Acts xiv. 16, xvii. 30. What
he says then is :—that the righteousness> of all who believe on
J esus Christ, of the Jews first, and then of the Gentiles, consiste
in the remission of such sins as formerly reigned in the world, and
stin reign in the unbelieving world3 and the remains of which,
although they do not reign, because resisted through the Holy
Spirit, are nevertheless still found even in believers themselves, as
long as they continue in the present state. The apostle, therefore,
“ lays down these two principles: first, that before Christ was mani-
fested in the flesh, the Gentiles indulged in al] sorts of sins, which

in the passages above referred to he calls their ‘⁶ ways,’'—‘ God
Ι suffered the Gentiles to walk in their own ways 3 ’ secondly, that
to those who believe on the blood of J esus Christ, the remission
of all these sins, great and numerous as they are, is sure, which
remission is our righteousness before the Lord.
