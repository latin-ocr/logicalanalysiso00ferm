measure to all, not even all who teach; but is given to each in
his own and proper measure, according as it has seemed good to
the Lord to give it to every one. ‘⁴ To be wise unto sobriety,’'
accordingly, is—-‘ in profession, and in teaching the Church, to
keep soberly and modestly within the measure of the undoubted

which it is illustrated is drawn from an extended similitude, the
protasis of which is contained in this verse, and consists of two
parts. “For as we have many members in one body.’'⁴ This is
'the first part of the protasis—“ we have many members 111 0116
body ;'’ where by “ body '' he means—‘ the human body,' or ‘ that

action? This is the second part of the ‘protasis concerning the
different duty, and gift for duty, of each individual member as
compared with the rest3 which differ-enee or diversity, both of
duty and gift, the apostle here expresses by the different action
of each member: the members of the external body have not all,
the same action, but every one its own proper action, distinct- from ν
