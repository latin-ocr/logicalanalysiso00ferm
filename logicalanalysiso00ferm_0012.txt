vi EDITon’s PREFACE.

perty of David Laing, Esq., to whose courtesy in placing it in the
hands of the Council, the members of the Wodrow Society are in-
debted for its publication, as they are for many other invaluable
services rendered to the Society by that gentleman. It is not in
the handwriting of Melville himself, but in that of Daniel Deme-
trius, a native of Frankenthal, a town in the lower Palatinate, four
leagues to the west of Heidelberg, one of Melville’s students at St
Andrews,* and who asserts that he transcribed it from Melville’s
own copy. It consists of one hundred leaves in small quarto.

As this work has never before been published, it was deemed
proper to issue it in the original, that those interested in Melville
might enj0y the satisfaction of perusing his ipsissima verba. In
judging of the work, the reader will not fail to bear in mind that
it was not purposed for the press by the author, and therefore must
not be taken as affording a specimen of Melville’s full powers as an
expositor of Scripture. It seems, in fact, to have been prepared
only as a book of notes, to be used by him in his class in prelecting
upon the Epistle to the Romans. Notwithstanding, however, all
the disadvantages under which it thus labours, I believe it will be
welcomed by the Members of the Wodrow Society, not only as a
valuable relic of an illustrious and venerable man, but for its in·-
trinsic merits, as expository of the words of the Apostle.

The editing of this work has been, to myself and to the printer,

θ’ See M‘Crie's Life ofMelvz'lle‚ vol. ii„ p. 492. May not this individua] have been some
relation of Emmanuel van Metern or Demetrius, the historian? He was a native ot
Antwerp, but having zealously embraced the doctrines of the Reformers, he had to
flee to this country, where he resided until his death in 1612. He was a voluminous
mitem—See Bioyraplzie Universelle sub vocc. Demetrius and Metern. There is a por-
trait of him in the Bibliotheca Belgica, with a couple of epitaphs, one written by the
eelebrated Ortelius, who was his kinsman‚ the other inscribed on a monument raised
to his memo ry hy his widow.
