70 LOGICAL ANALYSIS OF THE

duces glorying.’ The argument which he adduces is taken from
the disparate,—‘ hope putteth not to shame ς’ 01 if you please, and
perhaps more correctly, from the immediate contrary of Christian
glorying3 for the apostle here puts ⁶ glorying’ and ⁶ being put to
shame’ in direct opposition, so that the negation of the one in—
volves the affirmation of the other. He therefore reasons thus :—

‘ Christian hope does not put us to shame3

‘ Therefore we Christians glory in hope?

‘⁶ Because the love of God is shed forth in our hearts.” This is
the proof of the antecedent, viz.—‘ that our hope does not put us
to shame’, deduced from the adjunct of ‘ the abundance of its cer-
tainty, and of a sense of the love of God in the gospeL’ indicated
by the term “ shed forth :”*—

‘ The love of God is shed forth in our hearts 3

‘ Therefore our hope does not put us to shame.'

Το 1110 501110 purpose the prophet speaks in Ps. xi. 7 3 and the
apostle himself, finther on, when 110 says, chap. viii. 31, “ If
God be for us, who is against us ‘?’⁷ By “the 1010 of God” I un-
derstood here that affection wherewith God loves and encompasses
us, which is just that grace into which we 010 restored in our
reconciliation through our Lord J esus Christ: the same cause
therefore, is here assigned for the Christian not being put to
shame, as has before been assigned for his glorying in hope ; with
this difference, that what , 15 there styled “ grace,'’ and here
termed “love’' is amplified by the adjunct of its abundance, indi-
cated as has been already remarked by the term “ shed—forth.'’
This ‘ shedding forth' of the love of God I take to be that same
‘full persuasion' which we have seen in Abraham, chap. iv. 313
whence it appears that 110 1111151 maintain with the apostle that
justifying faith is not head knowledge merely, but also a feeling
‘ shed forth in our hearts by the Holy 'Spirit who is given unto 1153

Ηο illustr-ates this love of God by the efficient cause of its shed-
ding forth, which is-—‘ the Holy Spirit ς’ and the Holy Spirit again
is illustrated by the efficient cause of his dwelling within us, viz,

’Ἢ Ἐκκέχυται.
