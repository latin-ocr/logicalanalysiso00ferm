EPISTLE OF PAUL TO THE ROMANS. 283

which is seen in Christians themselves, the apostle divides Chris-
tians into two classes: to some, injury has been done3 others are
aimed at that they may be injured. Upon each of these classes,
according to their state and condition, there devolves a Christian
duty3 which the apostle sets forth, as above, first separately, in
vv. 19 and 203 then jointly, in the last verse. “Not avenging
yourselves.'⁷ This is the duty of Christians to whom injury has
been done, separately3 which the apostle sets forth by arsis and
thesis, or by prohibition and injunction contrasted. The prohibi-
tion is—‘ that they should not themselves avenge the injuries which
they have received from others 3' which is the usual and daily prac- ·
tice of the natural man and the world who know not Jehovah,
namely, to take vengeance upon each other for injuries received.
“ But give place unto wrath.’' This is the thesis, or second mem-
ber of the contrast, wherein the apostle shews Christians, affirma-
t-ively, the duty which devolves upon them whenever injury is done
to them3 their duty is—-‘ to give place unto wrath? This, some
understand of their own wrath3 so that the meaning will be--‘ that
Christians who have been injured should spare this wrath, lest they
be carried along by it to the immediate avenging of their injuries,
which is the manner and custom of a perishing world? Others un-
derstand it of the wrath of G0d; so that the meaning will be—-‘ that
those who have received injuries should not be wroth unto ven-
geance, but should leave those who do them evil, if they repent not,
to the wrath of J ehovah, so that their own wrath may give place to
the wrath of Jehovah, and that to him, the glory of inflicting ven-
geanee upon the wicked, in his most just wrath, may be ascribed?
Others, again, explain it of the adversary who does the injury3
so that the meaning will be--‘ that Christiane, like their Father,
should exercise forbearance, waiting, with much long-suffering, if
perehance God may grant repentanee even to those who do them
evil and injure them. I consider that these three senses are in-
cluded by the apostle‘in the words-—“ Give place unto wrath”-'-
taken by themselves3 fo'r the duty of giving place unto wrath is
established in all these senses, jointly, by the argument which the
