328 LOGIGAL ANALYffls OF THE

beginning of the good work: this is accordingly a fifth argument
for the injunction concerning cause of offence :—

‘We must not do that whereby the work of God in a weak
brother is destroyed, and the weak brother himself caused to fall
back from the beginning which he has made in J esus Christ 3
⁷ ‘But to put a cause of offence in his way by the free use of
food, drink, and the like, is to destroy the work of God in him,
and to cause him to fall back from the beginning which he has-
made in J esus Christ:

‘Therefore, we must not put a cause of offence in his way, by
that free use of things indifferent.'

“ All thing‘s indeed are pure3 but it is evil for the man who
eateth with occasion of stumbling.'’ This is a prolepsis, whereby
the apostle refutes an instance against the foregoing assumption :—
‘ All things,’ he who is strong might say, ‘are pure to me for law-
ful use3 therefore, although he who is weak may stumble, Ι do not
destroy the work of God in him by my liberty, since, using pure
'things purely, Ι (10 well? The apostle replies by a distinction :—
>‘I admit the genus, and that all things'are pure, and all things
lawful to you3 yet in another respect they are not lawful, inas-
much as there is evil in your eating and use of your liberty, on
account of the adjunct of your causing a weak brother to offend :
therefore that which, absolutely and simply, is to do well, becomes
sin to you, if you do it to the stumbling of a weak brother? This,

accordingly, is the same thing which the apostle elsewhere says of
himself (1 Cor. vi. 12).

21. “It is good not to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor (to do
any thing).’' He next proves the foregoing reply, viz.-—‘ that to
'eat all things, although, absolutely and in itself, pure and lawfifl‚
yet, incidentally and when attended with occasion of stumbling,
‘is evil ;' this reply, I say, he proves by what equally follows in the
'case of contradictories, thus: —-

‘ Not to eat, not to drink, not to do any thing,’ whereby a brother
stumbles,' is offended, or is made weak, is good. ,
