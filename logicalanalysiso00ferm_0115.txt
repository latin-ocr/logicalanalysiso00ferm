EPISTLE OF PAUL TO THE ROMANS. 73

‘ Those who, having been formerly unrighteous⁷ are justified
through the blood of Christ, being now justified, shall much more
be saved through that blood from the wrath to come ;

‘But we, having been formerly unrighteous, are now justified
through the blood of Christ3

‘Wherefore‚ much more shall we be saved through the same
blood from the wrath to come?

The apostle here uses the expressions—‘ not to be disappointed
or put to shame by one’s hope‚' and—‘ to be saved from the wrath
to come7’ as synonymous: for our preservation from that wrath is

the thing hoped for: and those who obtain it are not put to shame
by their hope.

10. “For if when we were enemies we were reconciled 10 God
through the death of his Son3 much more being reconciled‚ we
shall be saved through his life? This is a third argument for the
same, also from the less :—

‘Those who, having been formerly enemies, are reconciled to
God through the death of his Son, shall much more be saved
through his life3

‘ But vve, having formerly been enemies, have been reconciled
to God through the death of his Son3

‘Much more therefore, now that we are reconciled, shall we be
saved through his resurrection and life? Here ‘reconciliation
through death’ as the less, is compared with ‘salvation through
life,’ as the greater3 in the same way as ‘the justification of the

unrighteous7’ and ‘the salvation of those already justified: are
compared in the preceding verse.

11. “ And not only so, but we also glory in God through our
Lord J esus Christ.” We have here an illustration of the last con-
clusion from the greater ε it is—‘'our glorying in the meantime in
God, as ours by covenant, and 111 ourselves as his people‚ until we
attain salvation through the life of 1115 Son? This glorying is
here illustrated by its efficient cause, viz„ ‘our Lord ‚J esus Christ ;'
