26. “From the forbearance of God.'' This is a prolepsis, where-
in he anticipates an objection, by which the unbelieving, both
among the ‚Jews and among the Gentiles, endeavour to refute both
of the principles which he has laid down, and to conclude that
there were no such sins in the world before Christ was known, as
the apostle here speaks of, and consequently that the righteous-
ness of us who believe on Christ does not consist in their remis-
sion. Therefore they thus argue :——

‘ If the sins which are now remitted for righteousness to
those who believe are past, then God, who is a just judge, would,
in times past, have destroyed the world while still walking in
sin 3

‘ The latter, however, is false 3 he did not destroy them, but on
the contrary “ gave them good things, and filled their hearts with
food and gladness,’' (as the apostle speaks, Acts xiv. 17):

‘ Therefore the former also is false, and the world was neither
unrighteous in times past, as you affirm, nor is now to be justified
by the remission of sins.⁷

To this the apostle replies—that the proposition is false3 and
that although God, who is a just judge, did not destroy the world,
yet sin reigned in the world without Christ, because God bore
with the world even while sinning,' and “ endured,” as he else-

for destruction. ‘⁶ To declare at this time his righteousness.''
This last illustration of his reply, and of that forbearance of God
whereby he long endured the sins of the world, is taken from its
end, repeated from the preceding verse :—‘ it was not without
design that God bore with the sins of the Gentiles even when sin
reigned in them3 but for this end, viz, that at the time of the
manifestation of J esus Christ he might show—i. e. make known
to the world—his righteousness through saith in his Christ, or
that righteousness whereby the world, otherwise dead in sins,
might be justified in the sight of God z ' ‘because God,’ the apostle
means to say, ‘ was about ,at this time to exhibit this righteous-
ness by the manifestation of ‚J esus Christ in the flesh, before this
