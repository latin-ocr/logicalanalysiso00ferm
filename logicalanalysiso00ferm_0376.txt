house, and reproached God: this scripture therefore testifies, that
first David, typically, and afterwards Christ, properly, did not
please himself, but endured all the blasphemies of the ungodly, or l
of an ungodly world, despising God’s house, and reproaching God.

4. “ For the things which were written.’' This is a prolepsis,
whereby the apostle anticipates what he foresaw miylzt be objected,
and would be objected by his opponents against the scripture just
quoted. ζ Let it be granted,’ the opponents might say, ‘ that that
scripture which David originally uttered concerning himself, is
properly to be understood of Christ3 yet that scripture will not
prove that Christ did that, which from his example you conclude

holy manner, after Christ’s example-³ Moreover the apostle seemS,
by this quotation of scripture, although apparently foreign to the
purpose, to have taken occasion for a further argument: for ff
