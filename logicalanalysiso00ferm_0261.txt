ErisTLE OF PAUL To 'rme noMANs. 219

‘If the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world ;

much more shall their reception be, as it were, a resurrection from
death?

16. “But if,” &a This is the third argument whereby the
apost-le proves that the Israelites are to be recalled to God, and
will embrace J esus Christ. The argument is taken from the
adjunct of the ‘sanctification’ of that nation3 by which sanc-
tification I understand—‘ the separation from all the nations, and

the 'sheaf of new corn which the priest waved before Jehovah at
the beginning of autumn, as the first fruits of harvest, for the ac-
ceptance of the people3 or from those first fruits which were of-
fered to God after the seven weeks of harvest, when it was re-
quisite that it should be'unlawful for any one to eat either parched
or green ears, of the new corn of the year, before the offering
