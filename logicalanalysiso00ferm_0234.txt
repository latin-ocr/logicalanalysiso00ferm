former, the “word” is described by its subject and instrumental
cause : its subject is—-‘ faith on Christ apprehended by faith,' (un-
less you prefer to take “saith'' in its proper acceptation, and to
consider the description as drawn from the effect of the word 3) its
instrumental causes are—‘ the apostles of Christ by whom it is
preached ε’ ‘ this word,' says the apostle, ‘of which Moses speaks,
is the word of faith which we, the apostles, preach.' The apostle
thus anticipates an objection which the adversaries might be ready
to bring forward, viz—⁴ that in the passage quoted from Deut.
(c. xxx. 12, 13,) Moses is speaking of the word of the law, but not

of the explanation, of which again there are two members3 and
these are set forth by hysterosis 3 for ‘to have the word in the
mouth,’ which is last in order, is first explained. First of all, there-
fore, ‘ to have the word of the gospel in the mouth,’ the apostle
says is—‘ to confess with the mouth that J esus Christis Lord ;’
then ‘ to have this word in the heart' is--‘ to believe that God has
raised him from the dead,’ or, that having died for our sins he has
been raised up for our justification ε’ for so 1 take it the whole work
of redemption is to be understood by synecdoche, under the head
¹of the resurrection of Christ3 andhe purposely makes mention of
the resurrection, because, in the days of the apostles, nothing re,-
