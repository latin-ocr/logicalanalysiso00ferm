32 LooioAL ANALYsls OF THE

circumcision 3 ⁹ for if the whole advantage* of circumcision (le-
pends upon the keeping of the law, it follows that the uncircum-
cision which keeps the law has the same advantage with circum-
c1sion.

27. “ And shall not the uncircunicision, which is by nature, if
it keep the law, judge thee, who, through the letter and circum-
cision, art a transgressor of the law?’' This is the second infer-
ence :—-—‘ Uncircumcision keeping the law will judge circumcision,’
i. e. ζ will be an argument for judgment against the circumcision
of those that transgress the law 3 ' for if the advantage of circum-
cision be the keeping of the law, the uncircumcision which has the
advantage attaching to ciroumcision is better than the circumci-

sion which is without the keeping of the law. Which is the ad-
vantage of the law.

28. ‘⁶ For he is not a J ew who is one outwardly.’' The apostle
now answers the first boast of the Jews, vi2., their glorying in the
surname of J ew, and shows that this is no true cause for glorying:
and thus, throughout the whole of his reply, the apostle proves
that these Jews reasoned falsely from what was no cause, and de-
ceived themselves. This third answer is borrowed from the de-
finition of a J ew, and consists of two parts, an arsis's and a thesis.‡
For in the first part, which is contained in the 28th verse, he
shews who is not a J ew, viz, one who is a J ew outwardly, that- is,
by surname, (as he has said above), or by the letter, (as he after-
wards speaks) 3 or, which is the same thing, all are not Jews who ’
are the children of J udah by carnal descent ε So chap. ix. 6.
“ Nor is that circumcision‚ which is circumcision outwardly,’' i. e.
’“ in the flesh.” He here illustrates the arsis from the like which
has just before been demonstrated3 as the external sacrament of
circumcision, and the cutting off of the foreskin, is not that true
circumcision in which one may glory, (as has just been demon-

* Or superiority. †A negation. ζ An affirmation. ’
