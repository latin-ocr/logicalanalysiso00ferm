EPISTLE OF PAUL TO THE ROMANS. 105

because of the inability* of the flesh,' as he afterwards speaks,
chap. viii. 3. The expression, “ the law is spiritual,’' signifies,
‘ that the law is the word and instrument of the Holy Spirit ’—
the same who is the 44 Spirit of lifej’ or 4 life-giving Spirit ς’ whence
it follows, that the law is given for life to us, as was before said,
or that it is the necessary cause of life--to wit, if any onerbe able
to keep it, as we learn from Gal. iii. 12, and Lev. xviii. 5.
Moreover, by our being 44 carnal,’' is meant, ‘ that we are subject
to the flesh, and servants to sin and corruption 3⁷ for so the apostle
himself explains it, when he defines the carnal man to be him who
is “ sold, so as to be made subject to sin.'’

I would, but what I hate, that I do.''

16. 44 But if I do that which Ι am unwilling to do, I consent to
the law that it is good.” The apostle now proceeds to establish
each part of this experience, and of the foregoing assumption, se-
parately, and two several times. He first establishes the former,
viz, 4 that we know that the law is spiritual,' in verses 15 and 16 3
next, the latter, viz., ‘ that we know that we are carnal, or sold'un-
der sin,’ in the 17th, and following verses, as far as verse 22 ; when,
having established both of these a second time, in verses 22, 23,
the conclusion of the reply—‘ therefore sin is become death unto
me ’—is at length deduced in the 24th verse. The argument in
proof of the first part, and which is contained in these two verses,
is taken from the effect of the renewed and spiritual man, in so far
as he is renewed and spiritual, of which the apostle here, as for-
merly, adduces himself as an example: ‘ I, being renewed, and in
so far as 1 am renewed, consent to the law of God that it is good:
„ ‘ Therefore, I know that the law 1s spiritual?

He proves the antecedent from the adjunct of the contrariety
between his own renewed will, and those things which he himself
