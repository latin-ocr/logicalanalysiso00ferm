EPIS'rLE or PAUL To THE noMANs. 137

God, yet the apostle «John, lst Ep. iii. 2, says that “itis not yet
manifest what we shall be ε’ our glory therefore remains conceal-
ed until such time as our adoption shall be revealed. The glory-—-
to be revealed——of adoption, will be manifested‚ says the apostle⁷
in “ the redemption of our body 3 '⁵ where ‘⁴ the body ’⁹ is put by
synecdoche for ‘ the whole man z ' he says the redemption of the
body however rather than of the soul, because the redemption of
the soul being already accomplished when the saints, as regards
their souls‚ have departed to dwell with the Lord, yet this our
adoption and glory is not yet fully manifested: but as soon as
the redemption of the body shall have been accomplished by its
resurrection from the dead, then for the first time shall be fully
manifested both the adoption and glory of all those who are the
sons of G0d‚ and who already have the first fruits of the Spirit of
God. To this agree the words of the apostle John, lst Ep. iii.
2, “ we know that when he shall be manifested, we shall be like
him, because we shall see him as he is.’'

24. Ξ( For we are saved by hope.'' He proceeds to prove the
last-mentioned effect, vi2.—-‘ that those who have the first fruits
of the Spirit wait for the glory to be revealed.' The argument is
taken from the instrumental cause of the salvation or glory to be
revealed, thus :—

‘ We are saved by hope,' or ‘hope is the instrumenta] cause ancl
sine qua non of our attaining this glory : ’

“ Therefore those who have the first fruits of the spirit, and are
to be saved, wait for the full harvest and glory to be revealed.”

“But hope, if it be seen, is not hope.'' From the foregoing
proof that we are saved by hope, the apostle deduces, after the
manner of a corollary, the principal conclusion of his digression
announced in verse 17, viz—that we ought to suffer with Christ,
and to wait for the inheritance with patient endurance. The pro-
cess of deduction is as follows 2——

‘ If we do not see the salvation which we hope for, we ought to
wait for it with pat-ient endurance 3
