358 LOGICAL ANALYsffl OF THE

churches of the Jews. The argument is taken from a comparison
of majority :—

‘ The Jews have bestowed greater blessings upon the Gentiles ε
ἡ ‘ Therefore the Gentiles, as their debtors, should bestow those
which are less, upon the Jews!

The greater blessings, the apostle calls—“ spiritual” (τοὶ πνευμα-
τικοὶ) ; the less—‘⁶ carnal’' (erc) σαρκικὰ). By the term “spiritual
(blessings),” he intends—both ‘ the gospel,’ and ⁴ gifts of the Spi-
rit, of all sorts, conferred upon those who by faith have embraced
the gospe13' among which gifts there is one-——the gift and grace
of prophecy, not only ordinary, but extraordinary, according to the
place, time, and necessity of believers—whereby the Church is
forewarned, both concerning the future benefits of G0d‚ and the
judgments which he is about to bring upon the world because of
sin3 such as was that prophecy of Agabus. In this comparison
of majority, therefore, the apostle deduces both the reasons of the
debt of the Gentiles, which we have mentioned under the head of
the 25th verse.

28. “When I shall have performed this.” The demonstrative—-
‘⁶ this,'' in these words, denotes—‘ the journeying which Paul had

which I have just spoken.' “And shall have sealed to them this
fruit.” By “ fruit,’' he means—‘ the subsidy which had been pre-
pared, and for the sake of ministering which to the saints, he takes
his Journey to Jerusalem 3’ and he calls that subsidy—-“ fruit,’' be-
cause, just as good fruit is gathered from a good tree, so the J ewish
churches, and pious poor who were at Jerusalem, reaped this* fruit
from his faithful labours in the gospel among the Gentiles. In
*this verse, accordingly, the apostle deduces his promise, which he
>has before amplified by a twofold illustration :——“ I shall take my
'joumey, through you, into Spain? He also amplifies this conolu'-

4sion a. third time, in this verse, by a new adjunct of thetim& and Α
