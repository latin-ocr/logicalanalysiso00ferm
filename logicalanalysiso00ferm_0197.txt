131’1s'rLE OF PAUL To THE ROMANs. 155

The second testimony whereby he proves this, viZ.——‘ that he is
grieved on account of the Jews who opposed themselves to Christ,
is that of his own conscience. ‘⁴ By the Holy Spirit.” Inasmuch
as this latter testimony, namely, that of his own conscience, is
the very point to be determined, and equally obscure with the
conclusion itself, he establishes it by a second cath, and calls the
indwelling spirit of God to be a witness to his conscience3 for
when the conscience is said to “bear witness in’' or ‘⁴ by the Holy
Spirit,” the meaning is—‘ that the Holy Spirit is a witness to us
that we do not lie when we adduce the testimony of our own con-

the testimony of his conscience by the efficient cause, both of the
testimony itself and of the grief concerning which conscience bears

internal, and in the heart? By this the apostle would indicate
both the sincerity and vehemence of his grief 3 for grief, which
rhas its seat in the heart, is both more vehement and always sin-
cere, whilst, on the contrary, that which lies no deeper than the
eountenanee is nothing better than a pretence.

3. “ I could wish that I myself were anathema from Christ-’⁹
*The second argument by which he proves the anguish of his heart
on account of the apostacy of Israel is taken from the adjunct of
his wish or desire, whereby‚ like Moses under the law, (Exod.
, xxxii. 3⁶4) so he himself under the gospel, with holy zeal, prefers
, ’ his brethren, or rather the glory of God in the salvation of his
