LIFE OF FERME.

OF CHARLES FERME or FAIRHOLM‚ * the author of the Analy-
tical Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans, of which a trans-
lation is now offered to the public, little is known beyond a few
facts. For these we are principally indebted to two of his pupils,—
Principal Adamson⁷ who has prefixed a short notice of him to the
original edition of this work, published. in 1651, and Calderw00d‚
who repeatedly names him in his history.

From Adamson’s notice, we gather that Ferme was a native of
Edinburgh, and that he received his education there. To whom
he was indebted for laying the foundation of his attainments we
are not informed3 Crawford sayS,† that he was of obscure parent-

age, and was bred up in the family of Mr Alexander Guthrie.

* Fairholm appears to have been his proper name. Calderwood always writes it
Fal-holm, and Row says expressly‚ (Hz'st. qf the Kirk qs* Scotland, p. 421, Wodr. Soc.
edit.,) “ Μι- Charles Farholme, (alias Ferme contracte.'') Adamson, however, always
calls him Fermaeus, and. it is by the contracted form that he seems to have been usual-
ly spoken. of and to by his contemporaries. In the college books his name seems to
be written Pharm. On a copy of the Scholia of Didymus on Homer (Argent. 1539)
which seems to have belonged to him, the name appears thus, “ Mr Carolus Pharum‚’'
with the mono, “ Christus mihi vita.” In the Records of the Presbytery of Edin-
burgh, from 1593 to 1598, his name is usually written Pharum, but sometimes Ferum,
Ferme; and in a letter, dated 2lst February 1605, he signs his name “ Chairlis
Ferm.” I owe this piece of information to the kindness of Mr Laing.
