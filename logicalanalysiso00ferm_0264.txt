222 · LOGICAL ANALYs1s or THE

By “the branches” I understand—‘ the natural branehes of the
true olive,’ that is—-‘ the Jews 3' from this glorying of theirs against
whom the Gentiles are interdicted by a twofold admonition. For
when the apostle says—‘⁴ glory not,” the meaning is-—‘ take care
that y-ou do not either glory concerning their being broken off,
nor glory yourself, whosoever you are of the Gentiles, after the
flesh,* and through carnal pride, coneerning your own engrafting

Gentiles themselves? The argument is taken from the negative
effect or disparate—“ Thou bearest not the root ;'’ and the apostle

thus reasons :--
‘ If you, whosoever you are of the Gentiles, bear the root of the

true olive and of the Jews, into which you have been engrafted,
the honour would belong to you, and not to the Jews 3

‘ But you do not bear the root, but the root you:
‘Therefore, the honour that you have been engrafted into the
