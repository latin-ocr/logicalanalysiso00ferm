EPISTLE or PAUL To THE ROMANs. 163

from the example a general proposition, which is, and is commonly
called the proposition of the syllogism of the example, the argument
being from species to genus3 proceeding next from this general
proposition, he deduces therefmm, in full syllogism, a conclusion
similar to the third, or another particular case, the argument being
from genus to species 3 and thirdly, proceeding from first to last,
and arguing from the like, he infers the one particular case from
the other, aq. .·

‘All those who are “ the seed of Abraham,’' that is, who are
begotten of Abraham according to the flesh, are not also ‘⁶ children,”
or those to whom the covenant made by God with Abraham be-
longs ; but ‘⁴ in Isaac,'' says the Lord to Abraham, Gen. xxi. 12,
⁴‘ shall thy seed be called :’'

⁴ Therefore those who are the children of the fiesh are not the
children of God, but the children of the promise are reckoned for
the seed!

The antecedent, set forth under a contrast, is given in this 7th
verse.

8. “ That is, those who are the children of the fiesh are not the
children of God, but the children of the promise are reckoned for
the seed.’' This is the consequent of the enthymeme and proposi-
tion of the syllogism of the example, also set forth under a contrast.
By “ the children of the flesh'' here I understand,-—‘ those who,'¹
as it is expressed in John i. 13, “are born of flesh and blood,'' that
is, ‘are born by the power of nature,’ as was Ishmael from Hagar
the bondmaid3 by “the children of the promise '’ again, I under-
stand—‘ those who,' in the language of the passage referred to,
“ are born of God,” or ‘by the power of the promise itself,’ as was
Isaac from Sarah, when by nature she was now unfit for conceiv-
ing3 and by “the children of God? I consider are meant those
whom the apostle has before affirmed to be Israel in truth, ‘those,’
namely, ‘ to whom adoption, with the other privileges enumerated,

J have been given, not by outward ministration merely, but accord-
ἔῃ· ing to inward grace! ⁷ ’
