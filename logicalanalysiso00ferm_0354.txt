such contentions, and charges them not to receive the weak to
such strifes, because duty is thus more infringed than it is per-

formed.

2. “One indeed believeth that he may eat every thing.” He
, explains both the foregoing epanorthosis, and the injunction con-
cerning receiving weak brethren, by an induction of examples,
which consists of two parts: the first is contained in verses 2, 3,
43 the second in the 5th, and subsequent verses. In the first
part he observes the following order: first of all, he proposes an ex-
ample of a strong brother who should receive, and of one weak in
saith who should be received, in verse 23 he then subjoins an in-
junction to each concerning his duty, in verse 33 in the third
place, he adds, at the close of verse 3, and in the 4th verse, an
argument for the duty to be performed by the weak. This first
example is concerning eating or not eating, ‘in which’—the
apostle would teach us, as he afterwards teaches in the 17th verse
of this very chapter—⁴ the kingdom of God does not consist,' and
consequently, that both are in themselves indifferent, and continue
to be so as long as any one who is weak in faith eats nothing but
herbs: but if, after having been taught his wcakness‚ he does not
repent, but obstinately maintains that the kingdom of God con-
·sists in not eating, or in eating this, but not that3 then this same
‘ eating and not eating’ is no longer indifferent, but a heresy and
corruption of the purity of the gospel. This example is borrowed
from those Jews who, although they had believed, yet, from a con—
science of their worship under the law, thought that it was not
lawful to eat every thing, but that it was necessary to obey the
prohibition of Moses concerning things that were not to be caten.
These the apostle calls—“ weak (in faith)” on account of their
ignorance of the liberty of the gospe13 and, on the other hand, he
calls those—‘⁶ believers,’'. (πιστοῦς,) or ‘ strong in faith,’ who, hav-
ing embraced the saith of Christ, firmly believed, that 1n lawful,
use, they might lawfully eat every thing, since all things are pure

to the pure, for lawful use.
