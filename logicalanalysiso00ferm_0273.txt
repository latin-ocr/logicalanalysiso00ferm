Er1srLE OF PAUL To THE ROMANs. 231

tiles, may be provoked to emulation by their ·example,' (Deut.
xxxii. 21 ; Rom. x. 193 xi. 14.) the fulness of the Gentiles having
been thus brought in, the apostle says—‘ that there m'll be an end,
or that the hardening of the Jews also will cease, and that they
shall be recalled, 5ο that all Israel may be saved,' as he subjoins
in the following verse :—-

26. “And thus all Israel shall be saved.’' This is the conclu-
sion of the fourth argument, whereby the apostle proves Israel's
recal, of which the assumption has been established in the verse
immediately preceding3 and it is likewise the antecedent of the
enthymeme, which went before in the lst ver. of chap. x., as was
there remarked : this conclusion is therefore the sum of the whole

God. “All Israel.'' In this conclusion, “all Israel,’⁷ is opposed
to ⁶ a part of Israel 3' but the question is—of which Israel? of that
to which the present discussion seems to refer (see above, chap. ii.
28); or of that which is Israel in spirit, and composed both of
J ewish and Gentile believers? We answer, that it may be un-
. derstood of either. If we understand it of the former, then the
‘ partos Israel’ is the handful of the saved during the time of har-
dening, which has been reserved for God among Israel according
to the fiesh, and separated unto himself from the multitude of
those that perish, according to ‚the election of his grace3 while
those that perish claim to themselves, on account of their multi-
