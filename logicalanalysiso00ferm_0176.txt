134 LoochL ANALYSIS oF THE

changes of things, and the manifold judgments of God, which,
along with sinful man, created things, serving man, undergo (Gen4
iii. 173 iv. 11, 12.) ΑΒ these four things, viz. z—man rendered
vain by sin, the miserable bondage of created things under vain
man, their pollution arising from the contagion of his vanity,
and, in fine, the judgment of God, which, along with man,
they undergo—all these things, I say, I consider as included
under the name of this “vanity,’' to which the world has been
made subject. “ Not of its own accord, but on account of him
who hath made it subject.’' The apostle has thus shewn us
the first part of the condition of creation, viz.-‘ its subjection
to vanity? This he now goes on to illustrate by its efficient cause,
which he sets forth under a contrast. ‘Creation has been made
subject to vanity, not of its own accord ς’ this is the first member
of the contrast, and that which is said not to be the cause. “ But
¹on account of him who hath made it subject,”—this is the second
member of the contrast, and that which is affirmed to be the cause.
Therefore, that which is said not to be the cause of this subjection,
is the nature itself of created things, which were made free from
vanity, and which, of their own nature, would neither have
obeyed man now fallen, nor have been miserable along with him3
that again which is affirmed to be the cause, is the appointment of
a long-suffering God, whose pleasure it is, on account of the elect
who are to be called, that the world should be serviceable even to
sinners, Matt. v. 45. Or it may be said that this illustrationis
'taken from a contrast of ends—“ not of its own accord,'’ that is,
‘ not on its own account,’ but ‘⁶ on account of him who hath made
it subject (to vanity),’' i. e., ‘for the use of man, who, by his sin,
has plunged the world under vanity along with himself ;' so that
the ›meaning will be :—As the world was created at first for the
-use of man, and to be serviceable to him 3· so now that it has been
subjected to vanity, that iss made vain, and subject to corruption
'through man’s sin, it is yet preserved under this corruption, on
account of the expected renewal of 'the same man, along with
whom the world itself also shall be ,renewecL according as it. -is
