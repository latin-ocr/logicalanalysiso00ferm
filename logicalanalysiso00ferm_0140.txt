95 ⁹ LOG ICAL ANALYSIS OF THE

which goes before—‘⁴ What shall we say therefore ?'’——‘ Shall we
say that according to your teaching the law is sin ?’ “ far from iff’
answers the apostle. ‘⁴ Nay, I did not know sin, except through the
law.’' The second part of the reply is a simple negation—‘ the
x law is not sin3’ which, in these words, the apostle proves from
the effect of the law, which 15--ζ to make sin known? Under
⁴ the knowledge of sin' I conceive two things to be here included ε
--(1.) The difference between it and other things 3 (2.) Its own
essential malignity and deformity 3 so that ‘ to know sin’ is both
ζ to know what is sin, and what is not sin,’ or ί to distinguish in
things what are, and what are not 51115 3' and also ‘ to know that
sin is in itself evil.’ The apostle, therefore, thus argues :—‘ That
by which sin becomes known and 15 known to us, is not itself sin 3
for sin becomes known through the rule of right and wrong, al-
though that rule can never be itself sin 3

‘ But 5111 becomes known through the law'—which the apostle
here amplifies by a comparison of majority—⁶ not only did Ι know
sin through the law, but, what is more, I did not know sin except
through the law:

‘Therefore, the law itself is not sin? “For I had not known
lust, except the law had said—Thou shalt not covet.” The as-
sumption of this syllogism‚ and apodosis of the foregoing compari· ’
5011, viZ.—-‘ that sin is not known except through the law,' the
apostle proves by an example or specimen, which is—the trans-
gression of the tenth commandment, or ⁶ covetousness.' That it
holds good of this sin, the apostle takes for granted, as known by
experience from all the writings and sayings of all who have either
written or taught on the subject of sin, by none of whom has it
been said or written of covetousness that it is a sin: and hence,
he thus reasons :—

‘ Unless the law of God'-i. e. the law received and given by
Moses—‘ had said, “Thou shalt not covet,” I should not have
known from the sayings of others, that covetousness was a sin: -

'‘Therefore, not only is sin-known·fi·0m the law, but it is not
known except through the law? Sin is here said to be ⁴‘ knownj’
