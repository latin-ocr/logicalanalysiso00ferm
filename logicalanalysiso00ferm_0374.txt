332 LOGICAL ANALYsrs OF THE

‘The strong ought to apply themselves, and to do their utmost
to perform that which they are bound to do by debt, on account
of the benefit of strength which has been conferred upon them 3

‘But we who are strong ought to bear the weaknesses of the
weak, that is, we are bound by duty, and as it were by debt, on
account of the benefit of strength conferred upon us, not only to
bear with the weak, but even to help them in bearing the burden
of their infirmities ε

Therefore, we who are strong ought to apply ourselves, and do
our utmost to perform this?

The assumption is contained in the beginning of the first verses
“And not to humour ourselves.'' This is an illustration of the
assumption from the contrary :—‘ it is not the duty of the strong to
please themselves, or to humour themselves because of their
strength 3' where, observe, that these two things—‘ to bear the in-
firmities of the weak,' and 4 to please ourselves,’ are put in opposi-
tion after the manner of contraries : for ‘to please ourselves,’ and
‘ to bear the weaknesses of the weak,' are things inconsistent with
each other 3 so inconsistent, indeed, that they cannot co-exist in
the same subject, nor can he be a Christian, who humours himself,
and does not bear the infirmities of his weak brethren.

2. “ Therefore every one ,οἳ us ought to please his neighbour.''
This is the conclusion of the first argument, but so enunciated as
to stir up the weak, to check the strong, and to teach both that
they are bound to please one another-3 having respect, however,
chiefly to the strong, as being in greater danger of pleasing
themselves, on account of their strength, than those who are con-
scious of their weakness: so that the meaning is—‘ whether we
be strong or weak, we ought- to be prepared, not to please our-
selves, but each other mutually3 and especially the strong to
please the weaker! This conclusion is therefore directly opposed
to the evil which he here censui-es, namely-‘ that he who eats
every thing' should despise him who does not eat ;' andis of ‘the
same import with the proposition in the 3d verse of chap. xiv.—
