EmsrLE or PAUL To THE ROMANS. 165

well that from species to genus, as that which proceeds from genus
to species, he thus reasons, as from a parallel case :—

‘ Both the sons of Isaac and Rebecca were not accounted as the
seed, but only Jacob, who was the younger:

‘ Therefore, in like manner, all who are descended from Jacob
or Israel, according to the flesh, are not also Israel in truth.'

The antecedent is set forth in this lOth verse, amplified by com-
parisons both of majority and of dissimilarity. The comparison of
majority is, ‘that not only Abraham, but also Rebecca, experi-
enced this, viz., that all who are seed are not also children.' The
comparison of dissimilarity is, that Abraham from different wives

timony is that of God by Moses, cited from Gen. xxv. 23 :—

“ The elder shall serve the younger :’'

‘Therefore, all who are the seed of Isaac and Rebecca are not
also children3 but the one is a child, and the other a servant?

The antecedent is given in the 12th verse, being preceded, in
verse 11, by an amplification of itself, from the adjunct of the time
of the divine testimony, which is defined by its subject and dispa-
tates, ‘ God bore this testimony concerning the seed of Isaac and¹
