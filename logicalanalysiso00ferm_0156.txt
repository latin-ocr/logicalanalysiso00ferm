114 LOGICAL ANALYSIS or THE

and beyond controversy on the part either of Jews or Gentiles3
this, if you think proper, being supplied, the entire syllogism will
be as follows :--

‘ To those who are righteous there is no condemnation’—whieh
will be disputed by none3

ί But those who are in Christ apprehended by faith are right-
eous,’ as was formerly proved ι

⁴ Therefore to those who are in Christ, and who give evidence
of this by walking after the Spirit, there is no condemnation’——-as
he here concludes. This is the syllogism of the gospel, and stands
opposed to that of the law which is the following :—-—

( The condemnation of those who are unrighteous is just3

‘ But those who transgress the law are sinners and unrighteous:

‘ Therefore the condemnation of those who transgress the law is
just?

These syllogisms present the theory and general doctrine both of
the law and of the gospel 3 but because it is a particular explana*
tion, and not a general theory which is effectual either for direc-
tion by the law, or for consolation and salvation by the gospel,.the
apostle, in this discussion concerning life and salvation, descends
from the common theory to a particular application. Of this apss
plication there are two syllogisms relating to the law, ancl two to
the gospel: the first relating to the law applies sin, the second,
death 3 the first relating to the gospel, righteousneSS, and the
second, life.

The first legal syllogism runs thus :--·

‘ Whoever transgresseth the law is a sinner and unrighteous’
—which is the assumption of the general syllogism 3
= ‘ But I have transgressed the law '÷-conscience puts in this
assumption :

‘ Therefore I am a sinner and unrighteous?

i The second legal syllogism is the following :—

‘ Whosoever is a sinner and unrighteous, his condemnation is just,

for death is the wages of siff—this was the proposition* of the

general syllogism ;
