172 LOGICAL ANALYSIS OF THE

The apostle, therefore, would here teach us two things :—first,
‘ that the will of God is the rule of all justice 3’ and, secondly, ‘ that
every creature ought to acquiesce in that will, so that the creature
should acknowledge as just whatever seems to be according to the
will of G0d‚ nor ask any further reason for it than that it has been
done according to that will?

21. ‘⁴ Hath not the potter power over the clay, out of the same
lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour ?”
Having now shewn the blasphemy of this ‘ replying,' he goes on
to prove the falsehood also of the hypothetical proposition—‘ that
if God hardens whom he will, he is unjustly angry with those who
are hardened3' and the argument by which he proves it is taken
from the less 2—-

‘ The potter, a mere man, has justly power over the clay, out of
the same lump to make one vessel to honour and another to dis-
honour, without any stain or charge of injustice.

‘ But we, the whole human race, are¹ clay, and less than clay, in
the hand of God our creator 3 since he created us out of nothing,
whilst the clay is something before it is formed by the potter:
‘ Much more, therefore, has God our creator power over us men,
out of the same human race, according to his own most free will,
to make one a vessel of wrath by hardening him, and another a
vessel of mercy by shewing him mercy: and both without being
at all stained or charged with injustice? The assumption is omit-

ted by the‘apostle as obvious3 the proposition is given in this 21st '

verse3 the conclusion amplified fr0m the greater, is subjoined in
the two following verses, 22, 23 2-

22. ‘⁴ If indeed God, willing to shew his wrath, and to make ἱ

known his power, hath endured with much long suffering the ·
vessels of wrath framed for destruction? The amplification con-
siste of two. parts ε the first, which is contained in this 22d verse,
respects the wicked and those who are hardened 3 the second—

those to whom God shews mercy. The first is to this effect ιν· ·
