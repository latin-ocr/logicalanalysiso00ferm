318 LooloAL ANALYsm or THE

‘ Therefore each is sure in himself, that he is pleasing and serv-
ing God, whether in doing or omitting?

7. “For none of us liveth to himself.” By ‘⁴ us,'’ he means
here—‘us who believe,' whether we be strong or weak in faith3
and consequently, “none of us '' is here equivalent to-—‘ none of
us who believe :’ in this verse therefore he proves, from the genus
itself, the end from which he has just reasoned. The argument of
the proof runs thus 2——

‘ Whoever lives to the Lord, does or omits to the Lord, what-
ever, in living, he does or omits3

‘ But all we who believe live to God:

‘ Therefore we who believe, whether we eat or do not eat,
whether we regard the day or do not regard it, do it or omit it, to
the Lord, or in order that the Lord may be magnified.’

This 7th verse contains an illustration of the assumption, taken
from the contrary end :—

( None of us who believe lives to himself, that is, in order that
he himself may be glorified, or that he may serve himself:

‘ Therefore, all of us who believe live unto God?

‘ To live to God,’ and ‘to live to one’s self,' are contrary oppo-
sites t for whether a man lives to sin, or to Satan in sin, or to his
own pleasures, or to eovetousness, (each of which is found in the
Scriptures,) they are all summed up in one, when he is said-‘ to
’ live to himself 3' since whatever a man lives to, who does not live
to the Lord, he is deceived by appearanoes, and is induoed so to
live, because, under this pretext, he lives to himself, that is, to his
own advantage and glory. ‘ To live to one’s self,’ therefore, and ‘ to
live to G0d‚’ are here opposed to each other by the apost-le, as two·
contraries. ’ “And none dieth to himself.” He next explains the
contrary state, by what equally follows in the ease of privative op-v
posites ἐ- ’ -

‘ N one of us who believe dies to himself:

‘ Therefore,' by parity of reasoning, ‘ none lives to himself? ⁵
