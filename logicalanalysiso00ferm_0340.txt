298 LOGtCAL ANALYSIS OF THE

comprehends the transgression of the whole law concerning the
duty of man towards man: that disparate is—‘ to work ill to one’s
neighbour ;' whence the apostle thus reasons :—

( If love works no ill to its neighbour, then love is the fulfilling
of the law 3

4 But the form-er is true :

‘ Therefore so is also the latter.5

The assumption is contained in the first part of the verse.
“Therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.’' This, which is the
second part of the verse, is the conclusion of the last syllogism,
and is also the same with the proposition of the first syllogism.
Here it is worthy of remark, that the apostle defines ‘ love’ by—

denied, the other is affirmed. ’

performed by the Christian towards man, whether in the Church
or in the State, is included under ‘ love,' as a kind of abridgment.
The apostle, therefore, in concluding—⁴ that we must always love, ’
‘ or that the duty of love is, as it were, a debt ever to be paid by
the Christian to every man, yet never to be fully discharged,' at the
‚same time concludes—³ that the Christian should. perform every
