fourth one contains a common duty, to be performed by every Chris-
tian to each and all of his fellow Christians. For it is the duty of
all to do honour to all, as the apostle teaches us in the loth verse of
the foregoing chap.‚ where he says, concerning all Christians gene-
rally, both equa] and unequal—“ in honour go before one another.''

8. “ Owe no man any thing.'’ The second illustration is taken ·

from what equally follows in the case of contraries 3 for to “ render”
and to “ owe’' are contraries : the apostle, therefore, illustrates his
injunction, thus :-— ’

“ Owe no man anything ε

“ Render therefore to all what ye owe.''

An illustration must be. drawn from that which is more evident3
the apostle, accordingly, takes it as a thing known and evident—
‘that no one should continue the debtor of another in any duty 3’
whence he makes plain that which he enjoins, viZ.—‘ that every one
should render to another what he owes.' “ Except (this) to love
one another.’' This is an epanorthosis and correction of the fore-
going prohibition concerning owing no man anything3 the epanor-
thosis being taken from one⁷ and that the most common duty, as we
have before shewn on chap. xii. ver. 9-⁴‘ let love be unfeigned.'’
On account of this common duty of love, he corrects his injunction
concerning the prohibition of debt3 thus shewing‚ that ‘to love,'
in the case of Christians‚ is a duty of such a kind, that while always
andperpetually paid⁷ it is never fully discharged, but remains still
to be performed even by those who perform it best, that is, who
love others most. One reason for this is the foundation pointed out
by the-apostle in 1 Cor. xiii. 13, where he says-——‘ that love fail-
eth not, but abideth ever, even when faith and hope shall 663663
“For he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law.” This is a.
second reason for the epanorthosis, in addition to that from lst
Cor. xiii, and is taken from the effect of him who so loves as to be
no further a debtor in love. That effect is—‘ so to fulfil the law,
-that 116 who 'does so is no longer bound to fulfil it ς’ ,νν111611 is a
*thing impossible and that cannot be done ε for he who has fulfflled
