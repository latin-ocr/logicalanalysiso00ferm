284 LOGICAL ANALYSIS OF THE

apostle subjoins,—“ For it is written, Vengeance is mine3 I will
repay, saith the Lord.’' The apostle establishes both the arsis and
thesis by the authority of God, taken from the law, Deut. xxxii.
35, thus :—

( The avenging of injuries belongs to Jehovah alone, who pro-
mises that he will repay, and will perform his promise:

‘ Therefore Christians and those who believe on Jehovah should
not avenge their own injuries3

‘ Therefore, also, they should spare their wrath, that they may
give opportunity to God for being wroth with the wicked, if they
repent not, and for avenging, in his most just wrath, the injuries
done by them to his people; which is lais prerogative, as the
authority of the quotation from the Scriptures proves.

20. “ Therefore, if thine enemy hunger, feed him3 if he thirst
give him drink.” By “enemy,’' I understand here—‘ the enemy
of Christians who aims to do them injury :' this injunction, there-
fore, inculcates the duty separately devolving on the Christian
who is aimed at by an enemy, that injury may be done to him.
The duty is this——‘ that the Christian should encounter the enemy
who so aims at injuring him, by doing him good3 but the apostle
propounds the genus or general injunction in the form of a twofold
particular duty, borrowed from the Scriptures: ζ If your enemy,'
that is ‘he who would deprive you both of food and life, be
hungry, encounter him by feeding him, and ministering what is
necessary to his wants3 in like manner, if he thirsts, give him
drink.' This injunction the apostle establishes by two arguments.
First of all, he deduces it from the previous injunction, by reason-
ing from the greater to the less :—

‘ The Christian should not avenge injuries received:

‘ Therefore, what is less, he should not encounter an enemy,
who seeks, in the manner of an enemy, to injure him, by offering
injury, but by doing him good instead of 1njury3 and this deduc·

>tion the apostle indicates by the term “ therefore,'’ (οὐν) 1n the be- ’

ginning of the verse.
