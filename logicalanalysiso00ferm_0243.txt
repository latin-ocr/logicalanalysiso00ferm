EPISTLE or PAUL 'ro THE ROMANS. 201

in order that it may manifestly appear, in his reply to the second

objection, that although saith is from hearino· and the Israelites

07

also had heard, yet that they had not believed so as to invoke God
unto salvation. From this the apostle would teaeh us——‘ that al-
though faith is from hearing, yet all who hear do not believe, nor
from saith invoke God unto salvation3 for he proves that the Is-
raelites had heard, and yet he has shewn that they neither believ-

ed on God, nor invoked him.

19. ‘⁶ But I say, hath not Israel known (God) ?'’ By ‘ know-
ledge,’ I understand here that which belongs to faith3 and, aecor-
dingly, this is the second prolepsis :—

‘ But Israel also has known God :

‘ Therefore he invokes God, and shall be saved.'

The apostle denies the antecedent of this objection 3 and assei-ts
what was threatened by Isaiah against this people, viz.,—that al-
though they might hear with their ears, yet that they should not
understand with their heart 3' and this he here proves by a twofold
testimony. “ First of all Moses saith, I will provoke you to emu-
lation by that which is not a nation3 by a nation void of under-
standing will I provoke you to anger.’' This is the first testimony 3
from which, by a comparison of minority, the apostle thus eon-
cludes :—

‘ Those who are to be provoked to emulation in understand-
ing by a nation void of understanding, do not themselves under-
stand 3

‘ But Moses has predicted concerning Israel, (Deut. xxxii. 21‚)
that he is to be provoked to emulation in understanding by a na-
tion void of understanding :

‘Therefore Israel himself does not understand? The assump-
tion is given in this verse.

20. “But Isaiah useth boldness, and saith, I have been found

by those that sought me not, I have been made manifest to those
who asked not after me.
