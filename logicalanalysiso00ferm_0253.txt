EPISTLE OF PAUL To THE ROMANs. 211

spiritual callus,⁷ or spirit of deep sleep, so stopping up the eyes,
ears and mind, as it is there said in the prophet, ‘ that the table of
those who are in this condition becomes a snare, a trap, and a re-
tribution, and their backs always remain bowed down ς’ a definition
which is made up of the genus--“ a spirit,'’ and specific difference
—“ of deep sleep.’' This is explained by its various effects, of
which the first is-—‘ the darkening of the eyes of their mind,' ‘the
hardening and (as the prophet speaks) making fat of their heart ς’
the second—⁶ the turning of their table into a trap and a retribu-
tion ς’ the third—⁶ the perpetual bowing down of their back.’
Comparing these effects together, we shall see, in the first place,
that ‘ not to see the things which they see, not to hear the things
which they hear, and not to perceive the things which they under-
stand‚' is at once their sin and their judgment τ it is their sin, in
their abuse of the ministry3 for either to neglect or despise the
word of God when heard, his works when seen, and his grace
when offered, which is ‘ not to hear the word heard, not to see
the works seen, and not to perceive the grace offered to the under-
standing,’ is to abuse the ministry, and is the sin of those who
abuse it; and it is their judgment, inasmuch as in the time of the
long-suffering of God, and his gracious visitation of them—“ the
things which belong to their peace are hid from their eyes.''
- The second effect, namely,—‘ that their table should become a
trap and a retribution,’ is their judgment only begun3 which, as
it turns out for good to the elect, so it turns out for evil to those
that are left behind. The third effect denotes their judgment,
and their judgment complete, as appears both from the severity
of the judgment, which is—‘ the bowing down of th'eir back,' and
from its continued duration—-“ bow down their back always.'’
But for the clearer understanding both of the definition itself,
and of this comparison of effecte, we must briefly explain some of
the words which occur in the testimonies. -The first word requir-
ing explanation is—xoevoevQ}c;‚ [literally] ‘ a deep sleep like night‚’
whereby is denoted a most profouud lethargy‚ such as deprives

those .who are under it, of all ,sense of their own advantage. This
