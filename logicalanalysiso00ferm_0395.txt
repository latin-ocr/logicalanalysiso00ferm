EPISTLE oF PAUL To THE ROMANS. 353·

confirmation of Paul’s preaehing! If, therefore, you inquire eon-'
cerning the means by which the Gentiles were indueed to obedi-'
enee, Paul himself replies—‘ that it was by means of the preaohing
of the gospel, confirmed by miracles and the gifts of the Holy
Spirit3’ on account of which confirmation, and effieaoy in induoing
the Gentiles to obedienee, the apostle, in 1 Cor. i. 18, calls “ the
preaehing of the cross,” to those that perish—“ foolishness,” but to
those who are saved—“ power,” namely, from its powerful confir-
mation, and powerful operation. “ So that from J erusalem.’' This
is the second illustration of the indueing of the Gentiles to obe-
dience, from the subject-place :—‘ everywhere, from Jerusalem to
Illyricum, Christ, through me, has induced the Gentiles to obedi-
enee? This subject-place, again, is amplified by a comparison of
similarity :—‘ I have so induced the Gentiles to obedienoe in these
places, that in them all Ι have fulfilled the office of preaehing the
gospel of Christ: Moreover, ‘ to fulfil the office of preaehing the
gospel,’ is—‘ to effect that the gospel should be preaehed, not
partly, but fully? The apostle therefore says-2³ that in all these
places, from Jerusalem to Illyricum, he had not only planted, but
fully established churehes, by the preaehing of the gospel ς’ as we
read was done at Ephesus, at Corinth, and in Crete, where, by
means of his assistants, the evangeliste Timothy, Titus, and
Apollos, he watered, until he had fully established the ohurohes

originally planted by himself.

third illustration of the induoing of the Gentiles, from the adjunct
of the former ignoranoe of these same Gentiles who had been in-
dueed, through Paul, to obedienoe z-—‘ the Gentiles whom Christ,
through me, has indueed to obedience, had not even heard of J esus
,Christ before? 'That iguoranee is also amplified by a comparison
of similarity between Paul's desire to preaeh, and the ignoranee of

-the Gentiles :—‘ As the Gentiles had not even heard of Christ, so .

:was I eagerly desirous to preach Christ where he had not been even
,named- before? The apodosis of the comparison. is contained iia
