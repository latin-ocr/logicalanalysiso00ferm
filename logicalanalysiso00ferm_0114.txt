72 LooicAL ANALYSIS or THE

his love upon those, for whom, when they were only ungodly, Christ
died 3

‘ But we are those for whom, when they were ungodly⁷ Christ died.

‘ VVherefore the love of God is shed forth upon us, and his love
towards us superabounds.’

The assumption is contained in this verse being expresses] in the
words last quoted.

7. ‘⁴ Scarcely indeed for a righteous man will one die.'' In place
of the proposition itself we have here the proof of it, by reasoning
from the less to the greater :—‘ Scarcely will one die for a righte-
ous man ς’

⁴ Therefore his love abounds who dies for an ungodly man?

“ For perhaps some one may dare to die for a good man.” This
is an epanorthosis of the foregoing argument from the less, and the
reason why the apostle has added the particle “ scarcely’' in his
proof of the proposition, viz„ because it may happen‚ although it
can rarely occur, that some one may die for a man who is both
righteous and useful.

8. “ But God commendeth his love towards us, in that while we
were yet sinners Christ died for us.” This is the conclusion of
the syllogism with a repetition of the assumption: for ‘ to com-
mend the love of God to us' here is—‘ to display it shed forth upon
us? In these words the two following things are affirmed: first
-—‘ that God has shed forth his love upon us and commended it
above all the affection of all creatures‚’ which is the conclusion of the
preceding syllogism 3 secondJy—‘ that God did this and manifested
his immeasurable love, in that while we were yet sinners Christ
died for us sinners,' which is the assumption of the same syllogism.

9. “ Therefore, being justified by his blood, much more shall we
now be saved from wrath through him.” This is the second argu-
ment by which he proves that hope does not put to shame, taken
from the less Q·—
