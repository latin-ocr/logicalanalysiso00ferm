236 LOGICAL ANALYsrs oF THE

the first part, he admits, indeed, that the Israelites are enemies'to
God, but qualifies and softens the asse'rtion, first, by saying—
‘ that they are enemies to the God of their salvation, not simpli-
cium* and at heart, but secundum quid,† and as regards ‘the gospel 3’
secondly, by the end, vi2.——‘ that they are enemies to God for the
sake of the Gentiles themselves,’ that is, ⁴ that the gospel of the
kingdom may be communicated to the Gentiles ς’ and in this end,
especially, lies the force of the argument, thus :—

( The Israelites are not enemies to God, except as regards the
gospel, and for your sakes, that the gospel may be preaehed to
you ε

‘Therefore, do not you Gentiles triumph over the IsraeliteS,
although they are enemies to God.'

This first part of the corollary is dedueed partly from the fore-
going proleptieal discussion in verse 11, where it is said—‘ that,
through the fall of Israel, salvation has come to the Gentiles ;’
partly from the fourth argument, and verse 25, where it is said—
‘ that hardening has happened to Israel only in part, and until the
fulness of the Gentiles should come in ς’ the apostle, therefore,
thus reasons :—

‘ Hardening has happened to Israel, that, through Israel's fall,
salvation might come to the Gentiles 3 and only in part, and until
the fulness of the Gentiles should eome in ε

‘ Therefore, the Israelites are enemies only for the sake of you
Gentiles, as it regards the Gosp'el?

“ But as regards election, they are beloved for the fathers’
sakes.’' This is the second part of the corollary, which is dedueed
from the third argument, and preceding 16th verse :—

- ‘ The root of Israel 1s holy.
‘ Therefore, Israel themselves are holy and beloved by God;'
whence the apostle proceeds by a prosyllogism, thus: —·
· ‘ We must not triumph over God' s beloved3
‘ The Israelites are still holy and beloved by God.
‘ Therefore the Gentiles ought not to triumph over the Israelitesss
