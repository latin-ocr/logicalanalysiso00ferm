EPISTLE OF PAUL TO THE ROMANS. 225

‘ Π God did not spare the natural branches disbelieving, but cast
them out from their root, much less will he spare you who are a
wild olive, if you reject the faith in like manner with them3

‘ But the former is true:

‘Therefore so is also the latter ς’ that iss—⁶ God will not spare
you of the Gentiles disbelieving:

‘ Wherefore, (for there is here a prosyllogism,) you should take
heed to yourself, lest you fall away from the faith 3 but you must
not boast against the disbelieving Jews! The proposition only is
given in the text.

22. “ Behold, therefore, the goodness and severity of God‚’' ὥσ.
This is a corollary and conclusion deduced from the preceding
discussion, in which corollary he recommends to the consideration
of the Gentiles both the goodness and severity of God. By “ se-
verity’' I understand ‘ the judgment of God against the unyield-
ing,' a judgment most just indeed, yet especially to be dreaded:
under the name of “ goodness,’' again, I understand all those most
desirable effects of the gratuitous favour of God, which he gra-
ciously confers upon his beloved, and which are chiefly, and above
all other things, both to be sought after and retained by the elect
of God, or believers. “Towards those who have fallen, indeed,
severity, but towards thee, goodness.” The apostle illustrates
both the severity and goodness of God by their subjects, or the
objects towards which they are manifested: that of the severity
is explained to be-—‘ the nation of the Jews who have fallen away
from their root :' that of the goodness—‘ every one of the Gentiles
who has embraced Christ by saith? “ If thou shalt abide in his
goodness.'' This is an epanorthosis whereby he corrects what he
has just said of the goodness of God towards the Gentiles, and
warns them that that goodness of God will not be continued to the
Gentiles any longer than they shall abide in that goodness. ‘To
abide in the goodness of G0d‚' moreover, as the apostle uses the
term “ goodness'’ in this place, is ‘ by keeping the saith to stand
fast in Christ, for whose sake, and in whom, God has become good·
