EPISTLE or PAUL To THE ROMANS. 27 7

God, they may, by our blessing‚ be withdrawn from their cursing‚
and led to the God of our blessing.

15. “ Rejoice with those who rejoice‚ and weep with those who
weep.'' The second relation or respect of which others are the
subJect, arises from the different mental affcctions and internal
emotions which we see in those with whom we live. According
to these emotions the apostle divides all men into—‘⁴ those who
rejoice‚'' and ‘⁴ those who weep‚'' that is, ‘ those who are affected
either with joy or grief 3 and enjoins upon Christians—‘ to sympa-
thisc with both, and to be affected in like manner with them, so as
to rejoice with those who rejoice, and to weep with those who
weep.'

16. “ Be of the same mind one towards another.’' This is the
third relation or respect of which the persons with whom we live
are the subjects3 according to which the apostle divides all men
into—‘ those who either affect us with good as members of the same
body‚’ or ‘ with evil as opposed to us in a different body? The
Christian duty to be performed towards both is set forth by the
apostle in two ways: separately, in this lssth verse, and the begin-
ning of the next3 and jointly‚ in the close of verse 17, and in verse
18.

The duty to be performed towards those who are members of the
same body and do us good, or are our helpers for good, is set forth
in this verse⁷ and is threefold. First of all there is—‘ unanimity
’ and consent of mind in every thing that is good ς’ for otherwise, ‘ to
be unanimous‚’* or ‘⁶ to be of the same mind one toward another,'’†
and harmonious in evil, is not only not a Christian duty, but is an
agrceing together contrary to 'dutyz the apostle therefore *enjoins
that they should avoid feuds and altercations, such as are every-
where seen to arise among men from the flesh and' our corrupt
nature. ‘⁶ Not thinking highly (of yourselves) but yielding to the
lowly.'’ The second duty to be performed towards our brethren‚·or
