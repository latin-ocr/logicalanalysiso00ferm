31ss Loo1cAL ANALYSIS OF THE

given by the apostle to both parties in common3 both to him who
esteems one day above another, and to him who esteems every day
alike: the admonition is this :—‘ that every one of either party
should act according to his measure of faith ς and in such a way,
that what he does shall be what he believes to be pleasing to God.’

By this admonition, the apostle shews both those who esteem,
and those who do not esteem the day, how very near they are to
evil, unless they take heed to themselves. For if those who
esteem one day above another, have been taught the liberty which
is in Christ, they can no longer esteem one day above another, in
the Lord, and with assurance of faith3 because they are adverse
to known truth, and so are no longer weak believers, but- opposers
of known faith and unbelievers, ε the apostle therefore admonishes
such, that so long as they esteem one day above another, they
should examine the strength of their faith, lest acting against light
and saith, they be found unbelievers, and obstinate in a lie. In
like manner, he admonishes the strong, not to found their liberty
on implicit faith, or the authority of others, so as to have no assu-
rance of their liberty in themselves ε for in this way, even they will
not be strong, but weak, yea, acting amiss3 since they do what they
do, without faith or assurance in themselves. The apostle there-¹
fore wishes, 'that both the strong and the weak should do what
they do, according to their measure of saith, and in such a way,
that neither he who esteems one day above another, should do so
any longer, than until such time as he may be taught the liberty
of Christ, and that every day is to be esteemed alike3 nor he who
esteems every day alike, should so esteem it, unless, having been
taught the liberty of Christ, he be sure in his own mind, that in
esteeming every, day alike, he is acting rightly: whence it most
clearly appears, that in the judgment of the apostle, whoever be-
lieves, whether he be strong or weak in faith, should have assur—
ance, and be fully persuaded concerning that which he believes.
From this it is manifest, that if the advocates of Popery would
take their stan‘d upon the divine testimony, the controversy be·-
