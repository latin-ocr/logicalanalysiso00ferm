EPISTLE OF PAUL TO THE ROMANS. 81

part is,—‘ that the Mosaic law,’ for it is that which is here in
question, ‘was not prior to the promise and this righteousness
through the obedience of one 3 but that it entered besides
(παρεισῆλθε) and came after the promise of God concerning right-
eousness through faith ς’ for so the apostle himself explains itin
Gal. iii. 17, where he shews that the law was posterior to the pro-
mise by 430 years. The second part of the reply is--‘ that the
use of the law entering besides was, that the fall might be aug-
mented3 or that sin, which entered into the world through the
disobedience of one, might increase τ’ whence it follows, that
neither is righteousness through the law, nor yet was the law or-
dained to no purpose and without its use, since it was ordained,
after the promise of the gospel, not to take away, but to augment
sin. This use of the law, you will understand as accidental, and
with respect to us who are carnal and under sin, to such a degree
that not only are we unable to keep the law, but sin and that first
transgression of one, taking advantage of the law, is augmented ;
and thus the world, which came under sin by the fall of one man,
sins still more, and multiplies transgression by rea-son of the law
entering. How is it that sin is augmented by the entrance of the
law? In three ways. 1. By knowledge3 for sin, which before
the law entered, lay hid from view as if dead, and with respect to
our ignorance of it had no existence, as soon as the law enters
becomes known, is seen to exist, and perceived to live within us,
so that we die. 2. Sin is augmented in consequence of the law
entering, by our contempt of the law3 for he who sins knowingly
against the law, sins more heinously, inasmuch as to the sinful act
he unites contempt of the known law: hence our Lord says—
‘ that the servant who knows his Lord's will and yet transgresseS,
is to be beaten by his Lord with many stripes,’ as being a greater
sinner, on account of his contempt for ‘that will which he knew.
3. Sin is augmented by the entrance of the law, because our cor-
rupt nature, being curbed by the law, rushes ,with greater precipi-
tation and more readily *into sin ; as it is said—“ We strive after
