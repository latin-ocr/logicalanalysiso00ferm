Er1s'r1AE OF PAUL To THE ROMANS. 307

bers of the same state, or civil body, approaching the common
body of the Church3 and it tseems to be the intention of the
apostle to intimate this, when-he says, in the commencement of
the chapter—‘ that they are to be received ς’ since ‘ to be receive&
is properly a duty performed to those who approach. Concern-
ing this duty of receiving the weak, the apostle, in this chapter,
and the beginning of the following, lays down three injunctions:
the first relates to ‘the act of reception itself,’ from v. 1 to the
latter part of v. 133 the second is about ‘ not giving cause of
offence to the weak brethren whom they receive,' thence to the
close of the chapter; the third is in the beginning of chap. xv„
where he enjoins us ‘ to humour those who have been received ε’
and from the 5th verse of chap. xv. to the 15th verse of the same,
he concludes these injunctions touching the duty to be performed
to the weak.

1. “ Him‚ moreover, who is weak in faith receive ye.” The
apostle therefore addresses the strong in faith ; whence it follows,
that of those who believe on J esus Christ, some are ζ strong,' others
“ weak in faith :” andin these words the apostle prescribes to both
a Christian duty 3 to ‘ the strong,’ indeed, expressly, but to ‘ the
weak,’ analogously and by consequence. The duty of the strony
is—-‘ to receive the weak,' as Aquila and Priscilla received Apollos
at Ephesus, when he knew nothing except the baptism of John
(Acts xviii. 26). The duty of the wealc, on the other hand, is,
analogously and by consequence—⁶ to give themselves up to be
received by the strong,’ that is—‘ not to refuse, but to acknowledge
this duty of reception, as proceeding from God, and extended to
them from the mercy of God ς’ since it would be in vain for any
one to receive those who refused reception. I call those ‘ strong in
faith ’—‘ who, as they have embraced the saith of the gospel, so have
been taught the liberty in Christ of those who believe: namely,
‘ that to the pure all things are pure, and that nothing is impure
to him who is pure, unless he considers it to be impure :' for Christ

⁶has sanctified all things to believers by a new right in himself3
