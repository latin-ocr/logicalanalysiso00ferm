here speaks, whether joy in affection, or peace in life, could not so

15. Thus far, from the leth verse of chap. i., the apostle has
been engaged in discussing righteousness, and the life of those
who are made righteous, both that which is eternal, and that which
is begun here through new obedience 3 and has wound up the dis·
cussion by a twofold conclusion, in the ten verses immediately
preceding. Now follows the third part of the epistle3 in which,

his partnership with them 3 and next, by the establishment of his
authority. As regards his partnership with them, he professes
it when he affirma—⁴ that he writes to them as a brother to ,
brethren,’ or ‘ that he esteems those to whom he writes as
