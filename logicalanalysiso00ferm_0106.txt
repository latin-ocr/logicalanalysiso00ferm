term, 4‘ us,” as if the apostle had said, ‘ When I say for the sake of
us, I do not mean either all us men, or all us Jews, but only those
who believe, whether of the Jews, or of any other nation whatever!
By this restriction, therefore, the apostle both describes those for
whose sake the justification of Abraham has been recorded, by the
adjunct of their saith, and repeats the conclusion of the leading
syllogism—‘ that our justification, whether We be Jews or Gentiles,
is by bclieving.’ “On him who raised up J esus our Lord from
the dead.” In these words the apostle explains justifying faith by
its object, and the manner in which it apprehends its object. The
object is ‘ God,⁷ whom the apostle sets forth by a description from
his effect—⁴ He raised up J esus Christ the Lord from the dead?
The manner of apprehending him is, first, ‘to know that he is
mine,' and then ‘to cleave to him,’ both of which are here indi-
cated by the familiar expression of the apostle, ‘⁴ our ;'' for the
three formulae, “ I believe that God is,'’ ‘⁴ I believe God,” and ‘⁴ I
believe on God‚” differ in this way, that the first and second belong
to historical saith, and signify the three following things 2—13t,
‘ThatGod is 3' 2dly, ‘That he is such as he is described in the
word,' (for this is to believe that God is); 3dly, ‘That every word
of God is true,’ (for this is to believe God): but “to believe on
G0d” belongs to justifying faith, and in addition to the three
things just mentioned, signifies these two besides z—lst, ⁴ That this
‘God who is described in the word, and is such as he is therein
described, is mine3' i. e., ‘ that he is mine according to all his
attributes in the word,' or ‘that he is my God for blessing and
salvation ς’ 2dly, That I so rest in this my God, that I cleave to
him with my whole heart. ⁴⁶ Το believe on God,” therefore, is,
first, ‘to believe that God is 3' secondly, ‘ That he is such as' he is
described in the word ς’ tlzirdly, ‘That every word of his is true ς’
fourtffly, ‘that he is my God, and thatI am his ;' and lastly, ‘ that
I rest in him, οι· cleave to him, with my whole beart :⁹ and this is
the true way of apprehending God. ’
