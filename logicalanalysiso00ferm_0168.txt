126 LOGICAL ANALYSIS OF THE

for as the Father 15 the first person in the Trinity‚ the Son the
second, and the Holy Spirit the third3 50 the works common to
the three persons, which relate to externa] objects, and have re-
spect to 0100111105, 010 performed by the Father‚ in the Son,
tlzrougylz the Holy Spirit: ‘the Father‚’ says the apostle here,
‘ raises up the dead in the Son⁷ through the Holy Spirit 3’ and the
same thing may be said of all similar actions of the Deity‚-God
the Father7 as the first person, is the efficient cause first 111 order,
and 011 things are performed by hi1n3 the Son of God, as the
second person, is the second efficient cause, and all things are per-

these the first is taken from the adjunct of those who live after the
flesh‚ which is the disparate to that of all who have been renewed
through the indwelling Spirit3 this adj unct being the debt or obli-
gation, whereby those who are after the flesh‚ 010 under obligation

⁶ All who live after the fiesh are debtors to the flesh, that they
should live after the flesh3 ⁴

‘ But we, brethren, are not debtors to the flesh‚ that we should
live after the flesh3

‘ Therefore let us not live after the flesh.'

Only the assumption is given in the text, being infel-red from
the foregoing second proof of the assumption [of the leading sylla*
gism] thus :—

⁶ The body indeed,' that is—‘ the flesh, or our corrupt nature,’
‘ is dead3 therefore we are not debtors to the flesh‚ that we should
