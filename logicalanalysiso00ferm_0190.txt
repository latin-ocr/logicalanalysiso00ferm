148 LOGICAL ANALYSIS OF THE

implied in the interrogation, viz., ‘ No one shall condemn the elect
of God,’ or, ‘there is therefore 110 condemnation to me, nor to any
one who, being 111 Christ with me through saith, is certain of his
election ;’ and in this one part of the conclusion, the genus itself
of the general syllogis1n,* viz„ ‘that there is 910 one aquinst me
who am in Christ, and engrafted into Him through faith’—-is indi-
cated by synecdoche. 44 It is Christ that died 3 yea, more, who is
also risen again, who is even at the right hand of God.’' The
arguments for the reply are two. Of these, the first is taken from
the adjunct of the ‘humiliation' and. ‘ glory' of Jesus Christ, of
which glory two parts are here enumerated: ‘his glorious resur-
rection,' and ‘his glorious sitting at the right hand of God.’ The
argument therefore runs thus 2——

‘Christ died for the elect’—this is his humiliation—‘to make
an end of their sins, and was glorified for their justification3’ for
he rose again, and sat down at the right hand of God:

4 Therefore no one shall be able to condemn the elect,' or,
‘ there is no condemnation to the elect ;'

So that those of us who, through saith on J esus Christ, are cer-
tain of the effect of our election, are also, each of us, certain of
future salvation, and that there is to us no condemnation. 44 Who
also intercedeth for us.’' The highest step in this climax, and the
second argument, from the effect of Christ dead and glorified, is
⁴ his continual intercession, in heaven, with God for 115, by the
virtue of his own merits, as our only advocate ;' for we are not to
suppose that Christ still acts as a suppliant with the Father, as in
the days of his fiesh, since he 15 now glorified, and, as the apostle
here testifies, sits at the Father’s right hand 3 ’ but he now inter-
cedes for us, and acts as our advocate, by the perpetual display, in
God’s sight, of his own satisfac-tion, which 15 ever new, and ever
amply pleads for all the sins of all who are covered with that satis-
faction, even with the righteousness of Him who died and rose
again. The apostle therefore thus reasons :—
