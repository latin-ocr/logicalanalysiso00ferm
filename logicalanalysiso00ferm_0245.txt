EPISTLE OF PAUL ΤΟ THE ROMANS. 203

the Gentiles, and Israel has become rebellious against God, it fol-
lows that God has cast away his people, andthat Israel has ceascd
to be the people of God! The assumption also is colnprised in
the same words, verse 1, being implied in the interrogation—“ Hath
God cast away his people ?'’ that is—‘ as to the latter member of
the hypothetical proposition, viz, ⁶ that God has cast away his
people,’ you may see to it yoursclf, whether you have said so.’
“Far from it.'' To this objection the apostle replies in two ways:
first, by a negation as far as verse 7 3 then in verse 7, by a distinc-
tion. He denies the hypothetical proposition z——‘ I,’ says the
apostle, ‘ do not say, nor teach, that God has cast away his peo-
ple 3 nor does that follow, as you represent, from my preceding
reply in the testimonies adduced ou‘t¹ of Moses and Isaiah, The
apostle is not content, with barely announcing this negation of the
proposition, but sets it off, both with a deprecation of so great a
j udgment upon his brethren, and with an expression of abhorrence at
such blasphemy against God, as if nullifying the covenant which he
himself had entered into with his people Israel3 both the depreca-
tion of the J udgment, and expression of abhorrence at the blasphemy
being comprised by him in this one saying—“ far from it.’' “ For
I indeed am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of
Benjamin.’' He goes on to prove the foregoing negation, viz.—
'‘ that God has not cast away his people ς’ for which purpose he
employs two arguments. The first is taken from the most special Ἴ
species, whereby, as by an instance, he sets aside the genus or
universal statement which has been denied, in this way τέ-

‘ I am an [sraelite 3
ι ‘ But I have not been cast away by God.

‘Therefore God has not cast away his people Israel? The pro-
position of this syllogismis given at the end of verse l, and proved
from his procreative causes *-—‘ Abraham and Benjamin?

- 2. “ God hath not cast away his people whom he foreknew.·''
This is the conclusion of the foregoing syllogism, amplified by a
