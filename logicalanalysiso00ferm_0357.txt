EPISTLE OF PAUL TO THE ROMANS. 315

ture, yet—-as it is a just thing with him to justify those who firmly
believe on Christ J esus, for the sake of J esus Christ on whom they
believe—-that justice is agreeable to the will of God, and has the
the testimony of the law and the prophets (c. iii. 21).

5. “One man esteemeth one day above another3 another es·-
teemeth every day (alike.)'' This is the second example, or latter
part of the induction whereby the injunction given in the first
verse, with its epanorthosis about ‘ not receiving weak brethren to
strifes,’ are illustrated.

This example, likewise, is borrowed from the law, by the require-
ments of which the new-moons and various feast- days were sepa—
rated from other days among the ancient people3 the remembrance
of which so affected even those Jews who had been converted to
the faith of Christ, that, in their weakness, almost all who believed
retained their zeal for the law and ancient feasts: so J ames and
the elders at Jerusalem (Acts xxi. 20) acknowledge—“ thou seest,
brother‚’' addressing Paul, “ how many thousands of Jews there are
who have believed, and they are all zealous of the law.'’ One part
of this perverted zeal was—‘ the esteeming one day above another ς’
in which, indeed, the believing Jews at length reached such a pitch
of obstinacy, that they even urged the keeping of the Hewish feasts
upon the Gentiles, as may be seen from Gal. iv. 10-α Ye observe
days, and months, and seasons, and years. I fear concerning yon,’'
διο. :—this, Paul points out to the Galatians3 and this evil had
crept into that Church through the zeal of those called “ J udai-
zers.’' As therefore, in the previous example, ‘ he that eats herbs’
is called “ weak,’' so here, the “ weak” is ‘he that esteems one day
above another 3' and as, in the former case, he is called “ believing,''
or ‘ strong in faith‚’ who, being persuaded of the liberty of Christ,
ι. knows that it is lawi'ul for him to eat all things,’ so, in this verse,
he is ‘ strong in faith' who, being persuaded of Christian liberty,
⁴. esteems every day alike, and gives no preference, on account of
the ceremonies of the law, to one day over another?¹ “ Let every
one be fully persuaded in his own mind.” ’ This isan admonition
