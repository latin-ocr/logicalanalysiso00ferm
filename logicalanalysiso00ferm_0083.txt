EPISTLE OF PAUL To THE ROMANS. 41

21. “But now, God’s righteousness without the law has been
manifested”—-a Prolepsis in which he anticipates an objection
suggested by the foregoing conclusion of the assumption. Sensual
and natural men who were disposed to seek righteousness by the
law, might say to the apostle :——“ If, as you conclude, no flesh shall
be justified by the works of the law, then you take away from man
all righteousness in the sight of God, so that he can have no righte-
ousness before God at all. The apostle replies-‘ that the propo-
sition is false, and that our keeping of the law is not 1116 6016
ground of righteousness before God3 but that God’s righteousness
—namely, that by which man is righteous before God—has been
made manifest without the law.’ By the manifestation here
spoken of, tho apostle means that full and complete revelation of
righteousness which was made by Christ manifest in the flesh3
and, accordingly, he illustrates it by the circumstance of the time:
——‘ now, for the first time,' says the apostle, ‘has it been made
manifest, namely, by the gospel of J esus Christ? ‘⁴ Being proved
by the testimony of the law and the prophets'’—a second prolepsis
of the Jews, ignorant as they were of the gospel :—‘ Whence does
that righteousness of yours appear? they might say to the apostle,
‘ or, how can it be proved ‘?’ To this he replies, that although it
is without the law, yet it has the testimony both of the law and
the prophets, and is proved thereby, as he shewed the Bereans,
(Acts xvii. 11.) The testimony of the Law concerning the righte-
ousness of faith is this :—‘ that all those who have kept the law
are righteous3' to which the believer subjoins through saith :--
‘ although I have broken the law, yet I have kept it in Christ :'
whence the law testifies to the believer that he is righteous through
' ’ saith. As regards the prophets, they preached Christ -J esus, and

righteousness through faith on him. -

22. “ God’s righteousness (I say) through saith of J esus Christ,
unto all, and upon all those who believe.’' With a view to the

’ illustration of 1116 two last replies, the apostle here defines that
y . righteousness of God which he has spoken of as-having been made
