62 LOGICAL ANALYSIS OF THE

be.'’ He begins with the last, namely, the subject matter of his
saith, which is here explained by its efficient cause, viz., the pro-
mise of God, adduced from Gen. xv. 5-44 So shall thy seed be.⁷'

19. “ And being by no means weak in faith.'’ The apostle pro-
secutes the two remaining parts of the description, first, by enu-
merating the difficulties, and then by explaining the strength of
his faith in overcoming these difficulties. 44 He considered not his
own body now dead.'' The difficulties are two. The first is ‘ the
deadness of his own body.’ The apostle employs the term, 44 dead,'’
(νενεκξωμὲνον), to denote the effect next to death, and because his
body, although still endued with life, was yet no better than a

- dead body, as regarded the generation of offspring. “When he

was about an hundred years old.'' In these words he establishes
the first difficulty from the adjunct of the old age of Abraham, and
his time of life unfit for generation. He was a hundred years old,
not, indeed, before the promise was made, but before he obtained
the promise which had been made to him in his seventieth year3
whence the apostle says, in Gal. iii. 17, that the promise preceded
the law by 430 years. 44 Nor yet the deadness of Sarah’s womb.'’
The second difficulty was, 4 the deadness of Sarah’s womb.’

20. “This promise of Grod he did not dispute through unbelief,
but strengthened himself.” Next eomes 4 the strength of his faith,’
which is explained by three illustrations :—The first illustration is

η by a contrast—‘ Although such hindrances stood in the way,

Abraham did not dispute against the promise, but strengthened
himself in faith against hindrances and unbeliess' under which con-
trast there is concealed a tacit comparison of majority: ‘ he not

only did not distrust, but did not even dispute the promise through f

unbelief? “ Giving glory to God.” The second illustration of the v
strength of his faith is taken from its effect: ‘ believing against ⁹
hindrances‚ he glorified God as true ς’ and here the apostle teache's
us, in passing, that our giving glory to God increases and diminishes·
with our saith on God'3 referring to Numb. xx· 12, where God lays
