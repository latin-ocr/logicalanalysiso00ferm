EPISTLE OF PAUL TO Tum ROMANS. 103

the law should become death to man, or that the doctrine—that
the law is the necessary cause of death, should be capable of being
deduced from my teaching.’ “ N ay sin is become death unto me.''
This is the second member of the contrast3 where by ⁴ sin' I
understand as before original and sinful sin, as the apostle himself
explains it in this very verse, when he says—“ that sin might be-
come exceedingly sinful : '⁷ for this sinful and original sin produces
every sort of lust, or is the fountain and necessary cause of sub-
sequent sins 3 and these again, to use the language of J ames,
‘⁶ when consummated, bring forth death,'’ and that as its neces-
sary cause. The import therefore of the latter member of the
contrast is—-‘ that original sin, by producing subsequent sins, is
the necessary cause of death to man ε’ and this, the apostle says,
is the inference to be deduced from his teaching, and from what
he has just said—‘ that sin taking occasion from the command-
ment deceived and slew him3’ so that he has taught, not that
the law, but that sin, by occasion of the law, is become death unto
him. “ That sin might be shewn working death unto me through
that which is good.'' He next illustrates the second member of
the contrast, and shews why he taught that sin was become death
to him by occasion of the law, from its twofold end, the one of
these endsfollowing from the other. The first end is—‘ that it
might be manifested and known that so great is the power of evil
in sin that it wrought death, which is evil, to man, through the
commandment which is good.'

“That sin, through the commandment, might become exceedingly
sinful''—the second end, which is deduced from the former thus :—

‘ That which is manifested and known to produce evil out of
good, is manifested to be exceedingly sinful, or exoeedingly evil:

‘ But sin is manifested to produce evil out of good, or to work
death to man through the commandment :

⁶ Therefore‚ through the commandment, sin is manifested to be
exceedingly sinfu] or evil?

The apostle wishes therefore to say here—‘ that from his doctrine

⁶ the malignity, not of the law, which is without any, but of sin,
