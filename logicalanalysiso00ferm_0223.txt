EPISTLE oF PAUL To THE ROMANS. 181

and a rock of offence.” As, in the preceding verse, he called
J esus Christ, against whom the Israelites stumbled, a “stone of
stumbling ;'' so, in this verse, which is the last of the chapter, he
proves, by the testimony of the ancient Scriptures, that it was
predicted both that Christ would be a stone of stumbling, and that
the Israelites would stumble against him :—“ Behold, I lay in
Zi0n‚” says the Lord concerning Christ, “a stone of stumbling
and a rock of offence :⁵⁹ ⁴ see ἶ it is predicted that Christ is to be a
stone of stumbling, and that both to the Israelites and the JeWS,
both because the prophet is speaking of them in Is. viii. 14, and
because in Is. xxviii. 16, it is said, that this stone of stumbling is
to be laid in Zion, which is the visible Church? Moreover, J esus
Christ is called. ‘⁶ a stone of stmnbling,'' not because he occasions
offence or stumbling to any one3 for, although he is often rejected
even by the builders, (Ps. cxviii. 22 3 Matt. xxv. 42,) yet is he
that ‘⁴ precious and elect '' stone, ‘⁴ which is become the head of the

this here, the apostle subjoins—“Whosoever believeth on him

this stone which the builders reject, and at which both houses of
Israel stumble, all who are truly inhabitants of Sion, and genuine
membcrs of the Church of God, must nevertheless believe3 2d,
That those who believe on him shall not be disappointed nor put
'to shame by their hope, but shall certainly attain that salvation ⁷
which they wait for from him ; 3d, That that Salvation, although
certain, must yet be waited for patiently in holiness3 and that
‘ believers,’ as the prophet speaks, ‘must not make haste,' nor
grasp at any means of deliverance accompanied with transgression,
or illegitimate3 whence, in the 4th place, it follows, that it is
this stone of which it is said that it is truly “ precious,’' and
‘⁴ elected ” by Goth and which, consequently, is that ‘ rock,
