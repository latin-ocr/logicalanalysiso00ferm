EPISTLE oF PAUL To TnE ROMANS. 139

of that glory, as well as imploring divine aid, that we may not
fail in hoping or suffering:

‘Therefore, by helping ou'r weaknesses, as regards waiting for
the glory, he bears witness to that glory, that it is to be re·-
vealed.’

“For we know not what to pray for as we ought.'’ He goes
on to explain this effect of the Holy Spirit by a contrast, in the
first member of which, as we have aheady hinted, our weakness
is shewn by synecdoche. “ But the Spirit himself intercedeth for
us, with sighs unutterable.'' This is the second member of the
contrast, wherein is shewn the assistance of the Holy spirit, who
helps our weaknesses, which assistance is——‘ his intercession for
us 3' which again is illustrated by the adjunct of the manner, he
intercedeth—“ with sighs unutterable.’' By this adjunct of the
manner of interceding, the apostle would teach us two things.
First, he would teach us that the sighs produced by the Holy
Spirit of God in the sons of God themselves, often supply the
want of utterance and prayer. Secondly, that these sighs of the
Holy Spirit are unutterable, and that for two reasons: either be—
cause the inward sense of him who sighs surpasses utterance, so
that it cannot be expressed in words3 or, because the sighs of the
Holy Spirit surpass the sense itself, and, consequently, the utter-
ance also, of the individual sighing———as the apostle would intimate
in the following verse, when he says, ⁴ that the mean-ing of these

, sighs is known to God‚’ as if they often surpassed the comprehen-

sion both of angels and men, being understood by God alone.

· 27. “But he that sear-cheth the hearts knoweth what is 'the
sense of the Spiritss’ We have here a prolepsis, in which an ob·-
jection——arising from the foregoing mode of interceding sor the
saints, or rather from the aforesaid quality of the sighs wherewith
the Spirit intercedes for the saints—is anticipated thus: ·—

‘ Sighs which are not eomprehended nor understood, are useless

Δ. to the individuale sighing, and of no avail m helping their weak-

nesses;
