336 LoemAL ANALYSIS OF THE

to shame,'’ (c. v. 5.) Observe therefore here, that, according to'
the apostle, the twofold end of all scripture is :—‘ holy wisdom ς’ and
‘ hope that putteth not to shame.’

5. From this to the 15th verse, we have next the conclusion, and
that twofold: the one special, having a particular respect to the
duty of strong and weak brethren, concerning which the apostle
has heretofore treated in c. xiv.; the other common, having respect
to the whole discussion from the lb'th verse of c. i. up to this place.
The first conclusion is contained in the three verses, 5, 6, 7, am-
plified by the adjunct of the wish, or holy desire, of the apostle3 and
this wish he amplifies in a threefold manner. “The God of endur-
ance and of comfort.’' This description of God is borrowed from
the parts of ‘the instruction'* of Christians in the preceding verse:
and Jehovah is called—‘⁴ the God of endurance,'' not only because
he is long-suffering and slow to wrath, ‘ enduring with much long-
suffering the vessels of wrath framed for destruction 3’ but still
more and especially, in this place, because it is he alone who,
through his Spirit, works in his own people those parts of Chris-
tian wisdom of which we have spoken. “ Grant yOU.” This is
the wish or desire of the apostle——‘ God grant you to be similarly
affected one towards another :’ he desires, both for the believing
Jews who were at Rome, and for the Gentiles, whether strong or
weaker-⁴ a holy unanimity,’ or ‘mutual concord,’ so that neither
the weak should be offended by the strength of the strong, nor
the strong by the weakness of the weak 3 but that each should per-
form their duty to the others—the strong by bearing with the·
weaknesses of the weak, and the weak by pleasantly lending them-
selves to be instructed by the strong. “ According to J esus
Christ.'’ This is the second amplification of the wish, from the
adjunct of the manner in which he desires that they should be of
the same mind one towards another: the apostle desires that they·
should be of the same mind, not in any manner they pleased, nor
'in any other manner than that which is according to Christ Jesus‘.
