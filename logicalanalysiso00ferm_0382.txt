340 LOGICAL ANALYSIS oF THE

unto the salvation'of those‘who believe,’ and that by distribution
according to its objects : J esus Christ is the minister of God unto
salvation ‘to the circumcised,' in this verse ; and ‘ to the uncircum-
cised,' in the verses that follow. “For the truth of God.” He
here illustrates the first particular of the distribution, viZ.—‘ the
ministry of the circumcision,' or ‘ the ministry of Christ to the cir-
cumcised 3’ the argument of illustration being taken from the end :—-
Christ was sent to the circumcised “ for the truth of God ;” that is—
‘ that the truth of God, or that God is true in all the promises
which he promised to the circumcised, or the people under the law,
might become known and be made manifest to all, both Jews and⁴
Gentiles? “ That he might perform the promises of the fathers.'’
The sense which we have given, vi2.——‘ that the truth of God is
to be manifested by this ministry, whereby Christ is the minister
of the circumcision,' is plain from this exposition subjoined to the
foregoing end: for to be ‘⁶ minister of the circumcision for thev

‘chapter iii. verses 29, 30 ; whence, in chapfer iv. verses 11, 12,-
Abraham is called——“ the father'' both “ of those that believe in
uncircumcision, and of the circumcision.'' For this scrupulous sup-
pression, there seem to be two reasons. The first is, that he might
avoid offending the J eWS, to whom nothing was more incredible,
and even offensive, than that it should be said that God was the
God of the Gentiles also, or that the Messiah was to be sent to
{them unto salvation: as clearly appears, both from the hesitation of
, Peter, who 'would not> go to Cornelius until the mystery of the call·-
‘in'g of the Gentiles had been revealed to him by God, in a vision-3⁴ ,
and from the accusation· against him, when he returned to‘Jeru— j
