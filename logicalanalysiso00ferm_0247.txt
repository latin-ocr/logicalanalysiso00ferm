EPISTLE OF PAUL 'ro THE ROMANS. ‘205

3. ‘⁶ Lord! they have killed thy prophets and digged down
thine altars 3 and I alone am left, and they seek my life? He
establishes Israel's apostacy from its effects, three of which are
enumerated in this verse: the first is--‘ the slaughter of God’s

the third—‘ that they seek me, Elijah, to put me to death 3’ and

remain to myself.'’ Lastly, in the words—“ have not bowed the
knee to the image of Baal,'’ the Lord establishes his answer by an
argument of disparates, thus 2—-

‘ Seven thousand have not bowed the knee to Baal :

‘ Therefore,' the Lord says, ‘ they have been reserved for me,
and for my worship?

5. “ So therefore, at this time also, a reservation has been
made.'' This is the apodosis of the similitude, or consequent of
the enthymeme-—‘ therefore, at this time also, although Israel has
apostatized, yet a reservation has been made of those whom God
foreknew, “ according to gratuitous election.” By “ election,'' I
