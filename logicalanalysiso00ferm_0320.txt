27 8 LOGICAL ANALYSIS or THE

those who are members of the same body with ourselves, is—‘ ge-
nuine humility and the shunning of pride, as contrary to Christian
humility.’ Of this duty, two parts are here distinguished by the
apostle‚ opposed to the twofold pride which is seen in men: the
first is—‘ not to think highly of ourselves and of our own gifts 3'
the second is—‘ to submit ourselves and yield to the most lowly
and least members in the Church, for their edification in the com·
mon grace :’ whilst, on the other hand, there are in like manner
the two following parts of pride: the one—⁶ too high an esteem of
ourselves and of our own gifts 3' the other—‘ the contempt and
rejection of our weak brethren.’ This duty, compared with the pre-
ceding, is the cause of the former 3 for as pride breaks up concord,
so Christian humility both produces the same, and preserves it
when produced. “Be not wise in your own eyes.’' This is the
third duty, viz. ζ the shunning of that self complacency* whereby
one is pleased with his own opinions 3’ which is contrary to the
spirit of discernment, whereby one discerning modestly and wisely,
both in regard to his own conceptions, and those of others who are
his brethren, chooses and holds fast that which is truly good ι for
a man is said to be “ wise in his own eyes,'' when he is so puffed
up with an opinion of his own wisdom‚ as neither to think, nor en-
dure it to be thought, that there is any understanding except what
he himself understands and thinks. This ‘sels-complacency' we
may take either as a separate vice, or as the third and last degree
of that pride which we have mentioned as contrary to Christian
humility. I prefer, however, to view it in the former light, as the
vice which is opposed to that peculiar Christian duty or gift, which,
as before observed, is denominated ‘ the spirit of discernment.’†

the duty which is to be performed by the Christian towards those
who do him evil, and are in a different mystical body from that
which he himself is in, and that a body opposed to him. The
