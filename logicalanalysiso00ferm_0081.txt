EPISTLE 01⁴* PAUL TO THE. ROMANS. 39

to support their own lie, he in like manner uses his own previous
discussion for his purpose of refuting them. His reasoning, there-
fore, is to this effect :—‘ If Jews and Greeks are equally sinners,
then as regards justification by the law, the Jews have in no way
the advantage over the Greeks :’ ‘ But the former is true,' which
he proves by two arguments. Of these the first is a testimony
borrowed from the previous discussion :—“ we have before brought
the charge,'' that is, we have charged them, and shown that they
are liable to the charge.

—the second argument for the assumption, from the testimony of
scripture, continued as far as verse 19.

19. ‘⁶ But we know that what things soever the law saith, it

saith, it saith to ,all those who are in the law '-—is given in the
text, amplified by the adjunct of the common knowledge of Paul
and the Jews. To this so obvious a proposition the apostle sub-
j0ins the no less manifest assumption :—

⁴ But you Jews are in ' or ‘under the law :

‘ Therefore, contrary to what you think, the law utters these
testimonies concerning you.²

The argument is from conjugates3 for the words νόμος and
νομικόι, or the equivalent expression, ὅι ὄντες ἐν τῷ νόμιῷ, are
conjugates. “ That every mouth may be stopped, and the whole
world become liable to the condemnation of God.'’ He next
