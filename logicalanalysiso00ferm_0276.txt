234 LOGICAL ANALYSIS or THE ⁷

be regarded as the word of God, is that which has been committed
to writing by God’s amanuenseS, the prophets and apostles alone ς’
and, therefore, in adducing the word of God to establish what he
is teaching, he says,—“ According as it is written.” The testi-
mony of scripture brought forward is one, but composed of two
passages from Isaiah3 for it is a usual thing with this apostle to
make a single testimony of different passages from the prophete
put together into one: thus, in the 8th verse of this chapter he
has adduced one testimony, consisting of two passages from Isaiah,
to prove the hardening of Israe13 and so here he has framed one
testimony out of two passages from Isaiah, to establish the recal
of the same Israel to the God of their salvation. The one pas-
sage is from lsaiah lix. 20, 21, ‘⁴ the deliverer shall come out ot
Zion, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob ς

27. And this covenant [shall be] to them from me ;'’ the second
is from Isaiah xxvii. 9.—“ WVhen I shall have taken-away their
sins :⁹⁷ from both of which passages the apostle establishes, by the
authority of the prophet, the two following things: First, he
establishes, ‘ that Christ coming in the flesh is to take away ini-
quity, not only from the Gentiles, but especially from Israel, so
that he is to be acknowledged by that people as their avenger and
redeemerz’ and as this did not take place immediately on the
coming of Christ and the first publication of the gospel, on ac-
count of the hardening of that people, which he has before taught
has happened to Israel for the sake of the bringing in of the Gren-
tiles, the apostle infers ⁶ that this benefit will afterwards be con-
ferred by Christ upon the Israelites, and that they, although now
hardened, are yet hereafter to be recalled to Christ, for the re-
mission of their sins in him ; which recal will at length take place
after the Gentiles shall have been brought in, for the bringing in
of ‘whom hardening has happened to Israel! The second thing
which the apostle deduces from these passages is this, ‘ that the ' ,ἶ
covenantv- of God in Christ is to be with Israel after that previous
benefit shall have 'been bestowed, and God in Christ shaumw
