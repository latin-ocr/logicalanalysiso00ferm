142 LOGICAL ANALYSIS OF THE

volent affection of the will of G0d” (ἐυδοκίαν τοῦ θελῆματος
ἁυτοῦ); which, as the apostle seems here to intimate by dedUcing
the calling from the purpose, is the second foundation of all the
spiritual benefits which the Lord confers upon us in Christ. For
he first foreknows in Christ 3 foreknowledge, accordingly, is the
first foundation in the following 29th verse: then comes this
ἐυδοκία τοῦ θελήματος or purpose (πρόθεσις) of God, agreeably to
his foreknowledge3 according to which, as a second foundation,
God predestinatos, calls, justifies and glorifies us. All this, as I
have said, is implied in the mention by the apostle of that one
benefit ; so that when he says that we are ‘⁶ called according to

and are the called according to his purpose,' having thus far been
established by the common testimony of the picus, as we have re-
marked upon the preceding verse, is again proved by the apostle
in these two verses. The argument whereby he proves it is taken
from the adjunct of the indissoluble connection of the benefit's
whichare conferred upon us by God, according to his purpose,¹
with the divine foreknowledge (πξογνῶσει); and is stated in the
prosyllogistic form thus ε- ’
