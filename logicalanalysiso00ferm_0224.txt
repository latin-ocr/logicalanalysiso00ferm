Christ, which they now reject:

‘ Therefore, although they now reject the way of salvation
through saith on J esus Christ, which I announce‚ yet it does not

receiving the saith. The antecedent of the enthymeme follows,
long after, in the 26th verse of chap. xi.,—“ All Israel shall be
saved ;’' on the proof of which antecedent, as about to be a great
mystery in the Christian Chureh‚ just as the calling of the Gentiles
had been in the J ewish, the apostle dwells from the beginning of
chap. X. to the 33d verse of chap. xi, In this proof he makes use
of six arguments. The first of these is taken from the adjunct of
the apostle's deprecation‚ whereby he deprecates the judgment of
the present apostacy* of Israel, and prays in their behalf that they
may be gathered again for salvation 'in Christ. The argument
runs thus :— ’
