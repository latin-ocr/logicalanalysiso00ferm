84 LOGICAL ANALYsIS or THE

‘⁶ the fiesh'' in opposition to ‘⁴ the spirit”—survive in them even
till death. The question concerning this remnant of the flesh is—
‘ should we continue in it, or live therein ‘?’ That is—‘ ought a
Christian man to indulge in the works of the flesh, or those sins
which proceed from remaining corruption, in order that the grace
of God may be the more illustriously displayed by their remission

the spirit of God procured for us by Christ's death, our old man,-
or 'the corruption of our nature, has been c'ru'cified with J esus
Christ-⁹ whence we may see that all who have been baptised into
the death of Christ are also dead to sin, since their old man has*
