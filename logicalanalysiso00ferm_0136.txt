94 LOGICAL ANALYSIS OF THE

but of holiness eternal life? From these things the apostle would
infer, that the children of grace must not only abstain from sin,
but also live holily: and the argument for this may be said to be
from the contrary effects of contrary causes. The contrary causes
are, ‘ to live unto sin‚’ and ‘ to live unto God ε’ the effects of the
former, ‘ ignominy' and ‘ death :' of the latter, ‘holiness' or ‘ glory 3'
for holiness is glory begun‚ and ‘ eterna] life! To ‘ live unto holi-
ness7' is ‘ to live to the increase and perfection of our sanctification 3’
for the more holily any one conducts himself, the more he increases
and delights in holiness, since the Holy Spirit is cherished by holy
conduct 3 and the end is eternal life. Hence the apostle thus
reasons :—

‘ Those things ought to be done which are followed by much
fruit, with holiness and eternal life ς

‘ But, from the obedience which we render to God, there re-
sults much fruit, with holiness and eternal life 3

‘ Therefore7 those who are under grace ought to live holily and

obey God?

23. “ For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eter-
nal life in J esus Christ our Lord.” These two ends, viZ„ ‘ death,’
which he has affirmed to be the end of sin, and ‘ eternal life,’ which
he has affirmed to be the end of obedience, the apostle here illus-
trates by a comparison of dissimilarity, shewing that, although
eternal life and death are both ends, they are not ends in a simi-
lar sense: for that death is the end of sin, as its wages and just
recompense (ἂντιμισθίαν); but eternal life the end of our obedi-
ence‚ not as a merit or recompence,* but as a free gift in J esus

Christ our Lord.
