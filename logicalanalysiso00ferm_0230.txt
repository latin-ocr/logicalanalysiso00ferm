cured by his own keeping of the law, so that we ourselves‚ being
clothed therewith, may be righteous in the sight of God 3 ’ this is
the end : and then this righteousness is said ‘ to belong to all who
believe, whether Jews or Gentiles ; ’ which is the subject of that
righteousness, as before observed on the 22d verse of chapter iii.

5. “For Moses describeth the righteousness which is from the
law, that he who shall have done these things shall live by the1n.'’
This is the second argument by which the apostle proves the
latter member of the contrast‚ viZ„ ⁴ that the zeal of the Israelites
is not according knowledge.⁹ The argument runs thus 2——

4 Moses testifies that righteousness from the law is impossible
and unattainable by man ; but that the righteousness of faith is
easy and near at hand ε

‘ Therefore the zeal of the Ismelites, which is a zeal of the law,
but not of the righteousness of saith, is not according to knowledge,
but according to ignorance even of Moses himself in whom they
glory.’

The antecedent of this enthymeme is proved, part by part, from
a description of both kinds of righteousness 3 which description is
taken out of Moses, Lev. xviii. 53 Deut. xxx. 12. First of all,
the apostle shews the difficulty and indeed impossibility of the
righteousness of the law, from a description of the righteousness of
the law in this 5th verse, which is to the following effect 2—‘Who-
soever has kept these things, namely‚ the precepts of God, or of
his law, shall live by them 3’ by which description it is shewn
“ that there is 'no righteousness or life from the law, except to those
who keep the law, and that perfectly, so as to' continue in all
things that are written in the book of the law, (Deut. xxvii. 265)
Hence the apostle thus reasons :—

‘ There is no righteousness or life from the law, except to those
who keep the law in all respects and perfectly '—for this descrip-
tion of the righteousness of the law is from Moses3 to which the
apostle subjoins the assumption—

‘ But no man has kept those things which are written in the
