cease from the lawful use of things, on account of the ignorance
or weakness of another on that point? The apostle replies to the
antecedent of this objection by a distinction—“ that nothing is
impure in itself,” that is, ‘ in lawful use 3’ which member of the dis-
tinction the apostle amplifies by the adjuncts of his own knowledge
and persuasion, and the efficient cause of both :—‘ I know that
nothing is impure in itself, and I am persuaded of it3 and the effi-
cient cause of both this knowledge and persuasion of mine is J esus
Christ, who has procured for me a right to all things, so that all
things are clean for lawful use.’ ‘⁶ But to him who esteemeth any
thing to be impure, to him it is impure.’' This is the second mem-
ber of the distinction :—‘ some things, however, are impure for use
secundum quid, with respect to the state of the weak3 and inciden-

pure: for to him who considers any thing impure, his very opinion
of it renders it impure 3 not simpliciter, but because he himself re-
gards it as impure!

walkest thou not lovingly.'’ This is the second prolepsis3 the
strong might say :—‘ if it be true that nothing ‘is impure in it-
self, but only incidentally and with respect to the opinion of the
weaker, the whole fault lies with the weak, and none with me, who,
using my Christian liberty, eat all things as pure.’ To this objec-
tion also, as to the former, the apostle replies by a distinction,
namely :—‘ that the fault indeed lies with the weak, but in such a
way, that there is some also in the free use of things pure, viz.,
that while using their liberty, they grieve the weak: for, having
no respect in this matter to their weakness, they offend against the
common law of love, which commanda us to love our neighbours
as ourselves 3 in which love, if the strong do not walk, they grieve
their weak brethren by abusing their liberty? ’ “ Destroy not him
by thy meat for whom Christ diedss’ Thus far the explanation of
¹the judgment3 now come the arguments by which the injunction

is established. The first argument is taken from the effect of giv÷
