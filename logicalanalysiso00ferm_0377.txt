ward and material, patiently endured the reproaches of a wicked
world3 so, much more should we, through zeal for the salvation of
our weak brethren, who are God's spiritual building, bear with
their infirmities, and as Christ pleased not himself, so should we
not please ourselves. “ That through endurance.’' The apostle ex-
plains the foregoing end, or ‘the wisdom which we should learn
from those things which were written aforetime concerning J esus
Christ,’ by its parts, and more remote end. The parts are two
in number. The first is—-“ endurance,” or ‘ that holy patience
whereby we are to bear not onl)⁷ with our brethren, for their edifi-

the wicked, and be overcome by their evil,' as the apostle has be-

“ comfort'’ is said to be-—“ comfort of the scriptures‚'' for two rea-
sons: first, because, as the apostle has said in the beginning of
the verse, it is learned from all the things written aforetime con-
cerning Christ3 and secondly, because true and solid comfort is no-
where to be found except in these things. “ We may have hope-’⁹
This is the second branch of the exposition, or the more remote end,
whereby the ‘apostle explains ‘ the wisdom’ which we learn from
the things written aforetime concerning Christ, and which he has
