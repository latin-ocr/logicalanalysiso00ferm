Church, to observe, cherish, and honour according to its measure,
the measure of grace in the meanest of their servants.

11. “ In endeavour, not slothfu13 in spirit, fervent3 serving the
Lord.’' We have next the three injunctions respecting both
tables of the law: the first concerning ⁴ endeavour 3' the second
concerning ⁶ zeal according to knowledge 3’ the third regarding
‘ the object or aim to which Christiane should constantly have re-
spect in all their endeavours and zeaL' I call “ endeavour”—‘ the
sedulous outward diligence of a Christian man in performing the
duties, either of the first or of the second tablez the apostle en—
joins that this should be ‘ earnest ς’ but by meosis, to avoid offend-
ing the tender consciences of Christians, instead ofsaying——‘ earnest
endeavour,' he commands them to avoid the charge of ‘ sloth' in per—
forming these duties of a Christian man. “ Zeal’'——I consider to
be—‘ inward ardour propelling the outward members of the body,
so that these may be “the instrumente of righteousness” to the
glory of God, in the practice either of the first, or of the second
table of the law : this zeal he has elsewhere (c. ix. v. 3,) professed3
and by this zeal, the conduct of our Lord in overturning the
tables, and casting out those who traded as merchants in the house
of God, is defended out of the Psalms, in Matt. xxi. 13.* The
third injunction is annexed to each of the preceding, as an epanor-
thosis, whereby the apostle charges and enjoins upon the Church
to take heed to themselves both in endeavour and zeal; because
we see both endeavour and zeal which are not in the Lord: he
would therefore have them watch attentively, that in whatever
they do by endeavour or zeal, they may serve the Lord, and see
that they be not hurried along to any thing, either by inward zeal
or outward endeavour, unless both, the spirit and word of the Lord
lead the way. “

12. “In hope, rejoicing;› in afflictions, patiently- enduring; in

prayer, continuing constantly.'' Here follow, in the third place,
