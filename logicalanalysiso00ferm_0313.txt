EPISTLE OF PA'UL TO. THE ROMANS. 271

tions, 'and not proceeding at all from the heart, is diverse from
true love. The apostle, therefore, here commands that love should
not be feigned, but that, in as far as any one manifests love either
in his words or his actions, so far should his inward consciousness
be witness to him that he loves with the heart. To this agrees
the saying of John, (lst Epist. iii. 18,) ‘⁷‘ My little children, let us
not love in word or tongue,” that is, ⁴ in word or tongue only,' as
those who love seignedly 3 ‘⁴ but’' also “ in deed,'’ which is some-⁶>
thing more than to love in word only3 “ and,'' moreover, “ in
truth” (ἀληθείᾳ) likewise, which has its seat in the heart. This is
the foundation of the common (luties. Next comes a general pro-
position, consisting of two membersz-—(1.) “ Abhor that which is
evil ;'' (2.) ‘⁴ Cleave to that which is goodss' ,This proposition is
borrowed from Ps. xxxiv. 15, (Tremellius's version,) and comprises
the sum of the law in two parts—the first being a prohibition of
that which is evil, andthe second containing an injunction about
doing that which is good3 whence we are called upon to observe,
that there is a twofold duty to which sincere love binds us, and
that there is a twofold sin opposed to the duty of love, which all
we who love unfeignedly ought to abhor. The first duty is here
said by the apostle to be--‘ such a performance of what is good,
as may make it manifest to all who witness it, that, in performing,
we cleave to that which is good ς’ the second duty is—‘ such a
hatred and abhorrence of that which is evil, that all who behold it
in our actions may perceive that we are so separated from what is
evil, as to abhor it with our whole souls? Hence, there appears
on the other hand a, twofold sin, ‘or a sin of two kinds: the one
consists—‘ in doing what is evil, which is increased, if, in the doing,
there be seen in us who do it a delight in the evil which we do,
the opposite of that abhorrence of evil which is required in the

· sound doctrine of the gospe13' the second kind of sin is——‘ the

neglecting to perform, or even the co'ld performance of what is
good, from which all who witness ‘our conduct easily arrive at
the⁴ conclusion, that we by no means cleave to that which is

good?
