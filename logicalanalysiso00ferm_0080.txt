9. ‘⁴ What then? We do excel ?'' This is the last prolepsis of
the Jews from the preceding discussion of Paul, in which he has
vindicated the faith of God in the promises made to the fathers,
and magnified his grace towards the Jews, who were for the most
part unworthy and unbelieving, whose unbelief however did not
render void, but rather commended the righteousness of God.
From this discussion the Jews at length rise up and claim to
themselves an advantage over the Gentiles, as now established by
the support of Paul himself ; as if they had said :——‘ What! does
not your whole reasoning go to shew that we have an advantage,
and that much in every way (as before said); and are you not
therefore wrong in comparing us to the Gentiles, and concluding
that we are equally liable to judgment with them ‘?’ “For no way‘'
——a hypophora, or the subjoined reply of the apostle, in which he
convicts the Jews of sophistry, in arresting his reasoning concern-
ing the grace of God communicated to the Jews in the promiseS,
to their own justification, and that by the laws. The sense of his
words therefore is :—‘ although we Jews much excel the Gentiles
in having the oracles of God committed to us, that is, have
the advantage over them in respect of God who has been more
gracious to us, or has imparted greater advantages to us than to
them; yet as regards justification by the law, and in respect of
ourselves “ We in no way’' excel or are better than the Gentiles
themselves.9 That this is the purport of the reply, is proved by
what immediately follows. The Jews, therefore, have the advan-
tage of the Gentiles in respect of grace, which is what the apostle
has argued3 but not in respect of justification by the law, which
is the point in question. For we have before brought the charge
against both Jews and Gentiles that they- are all under sin. He
here proves his last reply, or that the Jews in no way have the
advantage over the Gentiles as regards justification by the law-
’ To prove this he adduces the conclusion previously argued, viz.:
—that all, both Jews and Gentiles, were sinuers, and held the
truth of God in unrighteousness, as aforesaid: and the apostle'
does this designedly, for as the Jews had abused his last discussion
