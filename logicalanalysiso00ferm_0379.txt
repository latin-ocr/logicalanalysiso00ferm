Ems'rnn OF PAUL To THE ROMANs. 3:37

Moreover, “ to be of the same mind,''* or ί to be mutually concord-
‘ant,’ is nothing else than—‘ that as many as belong to Christ
should believe the same thing, and act with unanimity according
to the scriptures 3’ so that the concord of Christians in J esus
Christ, wholly consiste in—the holy agreement of all, in the faith of
Christ, and the obedience of saith according to the scriptures.

6. “ That, with one accord, ye may, with one mouth, glorify God.''
This is the third amplification of the wish, from the holy end of
that ‘unanimity' or ‘concord ς’ which end is--‘ the glorifying of
God by all, with one accord, in the same manner, or, as it were,
with one mouth? “ The Father of our Lord J esus Christ.” This
is a description of God, whom he wishes them to glorify with one
accord, taken from the relative opposite—⁴ the God whom I wish
you to glorify is the Father of our Lord J esus Christ? He adds
this description, not only to divert the minds of Christians from
the polytheism, or multitude of gods of ancient Rome, which the
Romans, like other Gentiles, had formerly worshipped3 but still
more, in order that he may stir them up to glorify God with one
accord, by reminding them of the distinguished benefit which all
who belong to Christ enjoy from God3 for all who belong to
Christ J esus are assured that God is also their F ather in J esus

Christ.

s 7. Hitherto we have had the amplification of the first conclusion,
or the wish of the apostle: here we have the conclusion itself,
concerning ‘ receiving one another,' vi2.-‘ the reception of the
weak'by the strong, and the following of the· strong by the weak‚
with one accord? “ Even as Christ also hath received us to the
glory of God.” This is an illustration of the conclusion from the
like: the similitude, first and more especially, having respect to the
stronger, and¹ admonishing them ς’ next and secondarily, to the
weak also. The similitude is taken from ‘ our own' reception by
J esus Christ our Saviour3’ and is amplificd from the end of that ,
