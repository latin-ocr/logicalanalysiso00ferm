240 LOGICAL ANALYSIS OF THE

tol the word of God, so that from them this same grace sounds
forth and is published through the whole region, to be yet believed
in among the Gentiles. Through this grace, or mercy of God be-
stowed upon the Gentiles, the apostle says, that the Jews shall
obtain mercy, when the tinne of their recal and obtaining mercy

the Jews, in their own time, to emulation, that is, to embrace the
