EPISTLE OF PAUL TO THE ROMANS. 183

⁷ ‘The judgments of those, to deprecate whose judgments, and
pray for whose salvation, God gives an ardent desire to his saints,
are to be removed, and they themselves to become partakers of
the salvation of God 3
‘But God gives to me,’ says the apostle, ‘an ardent desire to
pray and deprecate in behalf of Israel :
⁴ Therefore, the present judgment and apostaoy of Israel is to be
removed, and they themselves are at length to become partakers

“ zeal of G0d;” and this is established by the testimony of the
apostle—“ I bear witness conseming them that' they have a zeal
of God.” “ Zeal,'' moreover, is a human affection compounded of
love and anger 3 because when we love what is good, and from our
love for the good which is beloved by us are angry, and from the
greatness of that love inflamed with anger at that, as an evil,
which threatens to injure or deprive us of the good we love, this
anger against what is evil from love of what is good, or love of
what is good kindled by hatred of what is evil, is called ‘ zeal.'
That zeal, then, whereby we are so affected with love towards and
desire after the worship and glory of God, that, from our love for
