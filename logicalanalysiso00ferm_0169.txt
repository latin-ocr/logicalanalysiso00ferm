EPISTLE OF PAUL To THE ROMANs. 127

live after the fiesh, for death dissolves the obligation ;’ just as he
formerly reasoned concerning the law at the first v. of chap. vii.

13. “ Foris ye live after the flesh, ye shall die.’' This is the
second argument of dissuasion, taken from the wages of sin, or the
effect of living after the flesh, which effect is the death of those
who live after the flesh. The argument runs thus :—

‘ If you live after the flesh, you shall die:

‘ Therefore live not after the flesh.’

The antecedent is given in the commencement of this 13th v.
“ But if ye by the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall
live-⁹ In these words the antecedent is proved by what equally
follows on the contrary supposition, which is put in contrast with it:

‘If, by the Spirit, you mortify the deeds of the body you shall live:

‘Therefore, if you live after the flesh you shall die?

14. “For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the
sons of God.’' Thus far one part of the leading assumption has
been discussed3 next, by hysterosis, comes the first part, viz,
‘ but ye are in J esus Christ,' or, ‘ every one of you is certain that
he is in Christ? This part is not, indeed, itself expressed here,
but is proved in two distinct members ; for it is first argued, ‘ that
they are the sons of God ς’ then, ‘ that they are heirs of God, and
joint-heirs with Christ 3' and from these two follows the third,
which is here omitted, viZ„ ‘ that they are in Christ 3' since no man
ean be a son or heir of God, without being in Christ. He there-
fore proves the first of these two members from the inseparable
adjunct of the sons of God, which is, ‘ to be led or guided by the
Spirit of Grod ς’ and the syllogism by which it is proved runs thus :—

‘ As many as are led by the Spirit of God are the sons of God,
and consequently are in J esus Christ3

‘ But you are led by the Spirit of God:

‘Therefore, you are the sons of God, and consequently in J esus
Christ!

The proposition alone is expressed in this verse; the proof of
