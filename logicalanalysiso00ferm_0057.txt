EPISTLE OF PAUL TO THE ROMANS. 15

were created3 Thcrefore God has made manifest that which may
be made known concerning himself, “To wit, both his cternal
power and Godhead,”--where “the invisible things of God ’⁷ are
illustrated by an induction of examples. “ For this end that they
may be without excuse? The apostle here illustrates his last ar-
gument, vi2., “the manifestation of God by the things which he
has created,” from its end and use 2——‘ The natural knowledge of
God among the Gentiles, although insufficient for salvation, was yet
enough to render them inexcusable?

The first is vanity——“ they became vain.'' By vanity I understand
a going astray fr0m the true God, and from the knowledge of him,
