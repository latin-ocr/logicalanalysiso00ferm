Errs'rLE OF P-AUL To THE ROMANs. 89

‘ Therefore he is risen to die, or to be subjected to the dominion
of death, no more?

When the apostle here speaks of Christ as ‘dying to sin,’ we
must not understand him as meaning the samo thing as when we
speak of our dying to sin. W⁷hen we are said to die to sin, it is
presupposed that we have once lived to sin : but Christ, who never
lived to sin, is yet said ‘ to die to sin,’ when by his death and pas-
sion he is liberated and set free from his suretyship for sin 3 the
ransom '¹⁶ price due for sin having now been fully paid by his death
and passion. For as we, until liberated through Christ, live to
sin, and are under its dominion 3 so the Lord J esus Christ, until
by his death he discharged the debt which we owed, was under a
load of sin, as our surety ε wherefore, although he ‘⁶ knew no sin,’'
yet by catachresis,† and in a certain sense, he may be said ‘to
have lived to sin,’ until sestree from that load of sin which he
paid for 11ος and ‘to have died to sin,’ when he paid the price,
and destroyed sin for himself and his people.

11. “ So do ye conclude that you yourselves also are dead in-
deed unto sin, but alive unto God, through J esus Christ our
Lord.’' The proposition having been now established, he repeats
the assumption—‘ that we are dead to sin ς’ and along with it the
conclusion—that we are alive, no longer unto sin, but unto God:
both of these he leaves us to conclude for ourselves from what has
gone before3 illustrating them, however, by their efficient cause,
viZ.—‘ Our Lord J esus Christ,' through whom we both die unto
sin, and live unto God to die no more.

12. “Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body.” This
is an inference, and further conclusion deduced from the foregoing
reply to the objection 3 in which the apostle lays down a twofold
rule for Christiane. The first part of the rule is-—‘ Let not sin
reign in your body τ’ by this the apostle would intimate, that

'¹‘ λῦτ οι.
