EPISTLE or PAUL TOTHE ROMANS. 301

have believed,’ I consider is denoted—‘ the time of the ministra-
tion of the law, and the whole period that preceded it, from
the first giving of the promise in Paradise 3' during all which
time they had the gospel, although more obsourely, and also the
gospel promises, in which believers trusted, both under the law, and
before the law. By 44 salvation’' I understand—⁴ the kingdom of
heaven, and the fulfilment of that kingdom in us ς’ which was both
said to be “ at hand’' at the appearing of the gospel, when that
kingdom was clearly revealed, and is to be consummated at the
second coming of the Lord. The apostle, therefore, in this verse,
reasons in the same way as the Baptist in Matt. iii. 2 :—

“The kingdom of heaven is at hand,'' or is nearer, now that the
gospel 1s coming, than it was in the days of believers under the
law, and before the law:

‘ T herefore, now that the time of the gospel is coming upon you,
repent ye,’ or, as Paul here speaks, 4 it is time that you should
awake from sleep and repent?

My authority for this exposition is the apostle himself, in Gal.
iii. 23—⁴‘ Til] saith should come, we were kept under the proteo-

to be revealed:” where the apostle teaches—‘ that believers under
the law were sust-ained by the gospel promises, until the clear reve·-
lat-ion of the faith,' or ‘ the manifestation of the kingdom of heaven,’
as John speaks, ‘ should come ς’ by which ‘kingdom of heaven,’ or
4 clear revelation of faith,’ believers in Christ, now under the gospeL
are strengthened and preserved unto the complete salvation which
is immediately to follow: so that salvation is ‘nearer to us now,
than it was to believers, either under the law, or before the law.
There 'is one objection to this exposition, viz„ that the apostle is
here writing to the 'Romana who, being Gentiles, were never
under the ministration of the law, and, consequently, could not
be said to have then believed. To this I reply, that it is true the
apostle is writing to those Romans who had embraced the gospel,
most- of whom were not Jews, having been brought in from among
the Gentiles ; but that the apostle here ad'dresses them as* no
