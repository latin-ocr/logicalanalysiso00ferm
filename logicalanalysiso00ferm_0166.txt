124 LOGICAL ANALYSIs oF THE

dwelling Spirit which is ‘ our renewal.’ Of this there are two
parts here set forth by the apostle ε the first is-‘ the mortification
of the body or old man 3’ the second—‘ the quickening of the Spirit
or new creature? “ The body'’ or ‘old man’ is said ⁴⁴ to be morti-
fied‚’' when we die to the body, the old man, or the fiesh3 as on
the other ham, “the Spi1·it” or ζ new creature' is said to be quick-
ened, when we live to the Spirit more and more every day : So that
what is here said—that “ the body is dead‚’' is nothing else than
what the apostle formerly said in chap. vi. 2—that (ζ we are dead
unto sin 3'’ and to say—that “ the Spirit is life‚” is the same thing
as to say—that ‘we live by the Spirit‚' or ‘live the life of God?
Each of these parts, viZ.--‘ the mortification of the body,' and ‘ the
life of the Spirit,’ is explained by its final cause 3 * for the Holy
Spirit is the efficient cause of both. But if you ask why the· body
is mortified or becomes dead, the apostle replies—“ because of sin;’'
that is—‘ in order that we may cease to sin7’ which cannot take
place so long as the body is alive, or while the corrupt nature pre*-
vails within us z or if you prefer it, when the apostle here says—-
“because of sin‚’' he may be understood to mean—‘ that we die
to the body because of sin 3 that is—because of a consciousness or
sense of sin, and a dread ofjudgment in consequence of sin3 neither
of which we can escape, unless we die to the body and our corrupt
nature. In like manner if you ask why and for what cause the
Holy spirit makes us to live by the Spirit, the apostle replies—“ be-
cause of righteousness 3⁹⁹ that is—‘ inasmuch as we have been re-
·conciled to God by the righteousness and full satisfaction of Christ
the Holy Spirit sanctifies us, or makes us to live by the spirit, for
this purpose, that abstaining from sin we may live unto God, to
whom we have been reconciled.’ The argument in proof of the

assumption therefore runs thus :—

‘ Those are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, to whom the body .

is dead that they may serve the flesh no longer 1n the lust-s there-
of, and to whom the spirit 1s life that they may serve God, having
been reconciled through the righteousness of Christ3
