there is none. The apostle, therefore, thus reasons out of thc
prophet :—

‘ No one, whether angel or man, has ever pcnetratcd into the
knowledge of the mind of God, or been able to act as his coun-
sellor in the conduct of his affairs ε

⁴ Therefore, the riches both of the wisdom and of the knowledge
of God are worthy of admiration?

35. ‘⁶ Or who hath previously given to him, and it shall be ren-
dered to him again ?’' He next proves what he has above said 111
the second part of the exclamation in verse 33, viz.—‘ that God is
most just, and consequently the rule of justice itself, both in all his
counsels, and in the execution of them all, although his counsels
are inscrutable, and his ways unsearchable! The argument is
drawn from the definition of θ1110110ος for justice consists in render-
ing again what has previously been given3 since it is the part of
justice to render justly, or as equity demands, to the giver. Of
this justice, as there are two kinds—distributive justice, and com-
mutative justice, so what we have said is common to both3 for dis-
tributive justice bestows nothing on him who deserves nothing,
but dispenses to him who has previously deserved reward or
punishment, as the case may demand3 while commutative jus-
tice demands that, in a voluntary and lawful contract, a just
price be given for a thing received in exchange. He, therefore,
o'n whom nothing has been previously bestowed, as a most free
agent, cannot be accused of injusffice, either in his counsels, or
in his ways and actions towards others. The apostle, accordingly,
thus reasons—

‘ He to whom no one, either angel or man, has previously given
any thing, so that it may be rendered again to the giver‚ cannot
be unjust, either 111 1110 0011110010, 01· 111 the execution of them, but
10 most just3

‘ But nothing has been, nor is it possible that anything could
have been previously given to God, by any one, either angel or

· man, so that it might be rendered again to him by God ε
