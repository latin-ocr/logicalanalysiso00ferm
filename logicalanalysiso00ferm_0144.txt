teaching that the law is sin ‚· for Ι teaeh and affirm that it is not
sin, but pure therefrom in precept, practice, and end.’

13. “Is then that which is good become death unto me ?” This
is an urging and prosecution of the second objection regarding the
law—⁴ that it is essentially and intrinsically evil ; ’ or, if youhlike
better, the second branch of that objection: for as there are two
kinds of evil—culpable evil, which is ⁴ sin,’ and penal evil, which
is ⁴ death :⁹ so the objection concerning the law ‘that it is evil,’
consists of two branches--the one, ‘that the law is sin,' to which
the apostle has just been replying, the other ‘ that the law is death,’
which he forthwith proceeds to answer. then it is said ‘that the
law is death,' I understand the meaning to be-——‘ that the law is
the necessary cause of death,' as we have above shewn: for the
objection regarding the law ‘ that it was sin,’ amounted to this—
‘ that the law was the necessary cause of sin 3’ the objection there-
fore conveyed in the words before us is—‘ that it follows, from the
teaching of the apostle, that the law of God '—by which I under-
stand ‘ the law renewed and ordained by Moses '—‘ is the neces-
sary cause of death‚' just as it was before objected—‘ that the law
was the necessary cause of sin? There is this difference however

between the two objections, that the present is a conclusion, or is ⁷

stated in the form of a conclusion. “ Is then that which is good,’'
that is—-‘ the law‚’ “ become death,'' that is ‘ the necessary cause
of death' “ unto me ‘?” whereas the former was proposed in the
manner of a question—“ (shall we say) that the law is sin ?-’' his
opponents, thus becoming as it were more confident, are also
rendered bolder from the circumstance of the apostle having a
little before admitted that our death is effected ‘ by occasion of
the law ; ' as if, forsooth, the manner of effecting were itself the
efficient cause. “ Far from it.'’ The apostle replies by a eontrast
—‘ not the law, but sin is become death unto me.’ Of this con-
trast the first and negative member is not a simple negation, but
is amplified with rhetorical warmth, by an expression of abhorrepce
at such blasphemy: the force of which is :—‘ Far be it either that
