EPISTLE OF PAL'L TO THE ROMANS. 107

therefore here teaches uS, that the renewed man is a twofold man,
viz„ the spirit, by which he consents to the laW, and the fleslz,
whereby he practises what is contrary to the law3 and that both
of these are perceptible to the Christian, and were known to him-
self by experience. “For to will is present with me, but I do not
attain to the performance of that which is good.'' This is a second
proof of indwelling sin, from the adjunct of the inability of the
renewed man to do that which is good, which is illustrated by a
contrast: ‘Although Ι am willing to do what is good, yet what is
good Ι am unable to perform :

‘ Therefore, in me (that is, in my flesh,) there dwelleth no good?

19. “ For I do not the good that I would; but the evil which Ι
am unwilling to do, that do I.”

20. “ But if I do that which Ι am unwilling to do, it is no more
I that do it, but sin which dwelleth in me.”

21. “ Ι find therefore (that I am under) this law, that when Ι
would do good, evil is present with me.” Having removed the
object-ion, he returns to his main purpose, and proves the antece-
dent of v. '1 7 —that not himself, but sin which was in him practised
that which was contrary to the law. The argument is from dis-
parates :—-

‘ If Ι do that which I am unwilling to do, it is not I that do it,
but sin which is in me3 ,

‘ But the evil which Ι (101 am unwilling to do : =

‘ Therefore the evil which Ι do, it is not Ι that do, but sin which
is in me.’

The conclusion has been already given in v. 17 ; the assumption
is contained in v. 19, being illustrated by contrast—“ I do not the
good that I would, but the evil which I am unwilling to do, that
do I ;'' the proposition, follows in the 20th v. The antecedent
having been thus proved, the consequent is deduced therefrom in
the 2lst v., as was before observed under v. 17.
