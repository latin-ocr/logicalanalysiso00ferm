228 LOGchL ANALsts or THE

25. We have here the fourth argument by which the apostle
proves that the Jews are to be recalled to the God of their salva»
tion. The argument is taken from the contrary, and the adjunct
of the contrary : ⁶ the hardening of the Jews' is contrary to their
reca13 and the adjunct of the hardening is here represented as
consisting in two things—lst, it is ‘in part,’ and 2dly, it is ‘for a
time.’ Hence, therefore, the apostlc thus reasons :—

( Those who have been rejected, or hardened, in part merely, or
for a time only, are to be recalled in their own time ς

‘But the Jews have been rejected in part only, and for a defi-
nite time :

‘ Therefore they are to be recalled in their own time!

‘4 For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this
mystery.’' The apostle first illustra-tes the assumption of the fore-
going syllogism, viZ.—‘ that hardening has happened to Israel in
part, and for a time,' from its genus: it is a ‘⁶ mystery‚” or ι a
thing known only to those to whom it has been revealed from
God? He then proves this mystery, or secret revealed from Orod,
by the adjunct of apostolical authority 3 and that—with a view to
move the Gentiles the more—embellished with a rhetorical wish.'v

‘I Paul, both an apostle and prophet of the New Testament,
announce this to you Gentiles as a mystery, or secret revealed
from God, which Ι would that you Gentiles also should not be
ignorant of, namely, that hardening has happened to Israel in part,
and for a time : ’

‘ Therefore you are thus to judge, and to know upon apostolical
authority, that hardening in part, and for a time, has happened to
Israel!

“Lest ye be wise in your own eyes.” In passing, he inserts,
within a parenthesis, the reason for which he has revealed to them
this mystery, and why he wishes the Gentiles not to be ignorant
of it. The argument is drawn from the end, thus :—‘ I annorum&
this mystery to you Gentiles, and would not that you should 1be
ignorant of it, lest you be wise in your own judgment} thainis,
⁴ lest, contrary to the command of Christ, (Matt. xi. 29,) and ‚eon-5
