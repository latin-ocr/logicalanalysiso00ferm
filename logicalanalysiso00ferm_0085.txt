the common grace, a thing which the Jews could hardly be induced
to believe. The last particular is, the instrumental cause of this
righteousness, which is faith, agreeing not to Christ the principal,
but to us the subordinate subject. For Christ is righteous, not
by faith, or another justifying him, but by keeping the law per-
fectly 3 whereas, we, on the contrary, who are secondarily righte-
ous, become so, not by keeping the law, but through faith in a
justifying Christ: the faith of J esus Christ, therefore, is the in-

x strumental cause of our righteousness. The exhibition of this

righteousness by God, through the preaching of the gospel, and
its reception through the operation of the Holy spirit, when the
gospel is heard, the apostle denotes by the prepositions “nuto''
and “ upon ;” for all righteousness is exhibited by the preaching

of faith, or of the gospel preached: Or these prepositions may be
referred to those acts of God of which we have spoken3 so that
“ unto”—a preposition of motion—may denote the giving and im-

there is no distinction.'’ These words assign the reason for the
use of the universal term “alh'’ and for its being twice repeated,
as has been already remarked.

as the apostle himself explains it in Gal. iii. 23 2-

‘ All, both Jews and Gentiles, have sinned, and come short of
the glory of God, that all of both classes may be justified freely τ’
or, as he speaks in the passage referred t0,—“ the Scripture hath
concluded all under sin, that the promise from faith of J esus Christ
might be given to those that believe.'’

‘ Wherefore‚ the promise, or free justification‘ through saith, >is
