206 LOGICAL ANALYsts OF THE

understand, not that whereby the reserved Israelites choose God,
but that whereby God has chosen them to be reserved: for al-
though the faithful servants of God, rejecting idols and false gods,
choose the true God in Christ to be worshipped by them, as we
read of Joshua and the Israelites (Josh. xxiv. 15, 16.); yet the
same thing which the apostle John affirms concerning love,
(1 John iv. 10.) is here to be said concerning election, viz.—‘ that
we have not chosen God, but that he has first chosen us,' and by
his election, has reserved us for himself. The apostle, therefore,
here explains what was before said in the divine answer * in the
4th verse, “ I have caused to remain to myself,” (κατέλιπον
ἐμαυτῷ) and infers the adjunct of the manner of reservation from
its necessary efficient cause :—

‘ It is God himself who, of himself, reserves for himself whoever
are reserved,'—this is asserted in the divine answer.

ζ Therefore, whoever are reserved, their reservation is made ac-
cording to the gratuitous election of God,'—which is thence in-
ferred, and here announced by the apostle.

This is an inference and conclusion deduced from the manner of
making the reservation, of which he has spoken in the preceding
verse3 for the apostle reasons thus :—-

‘ lf the reservation of those who, amid the common apostacy of
the majority, have been reserved to righteousness and life, be
through the grace of the divine election, then is their reservation
not from works 3
, ‘But the former is true ε

‘ Therefore, so is also the latter?

The assumption of this syllogism has been already given in the
preceding verse3 the proposition is contained in the commence-
ment of this verse. ‘⁴ Otherwise, grace is no longer grace.'’ He
goes on to prove the proposition by two arguments. The first of
