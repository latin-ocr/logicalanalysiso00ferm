EPISTLE OF PAUL TO THE ROMANS. 341

salem, (Acts xi. 2.) The second is, because there was no ministry
of the uncircumcision, as there was of the circumcision, until Christ
himself, the shepherd of the sheep, came to gather into one body
with the people of the circumcision, the Gentiles, scattered and -
straying without a shepherd 3 as he himself teaches the circumcised,
John x, 16. Thus, therefore, he suppresses the second particu-
lar of the distribution. In these words, however, we have his illus-
tration of it, which is taken, like that of the first particular, from the
end ; so that the full meaning of the passage is this 2-—J esus Christ is
the minister of God ωηο salvation to the Gentiles, in order that
the Gentiles may glorify God :’ and this glorifying of God by the
Gentiles is here explained by its efficient cause, which is—‘ the
mercy of God appearing in the mission of his promised Son, as

‘confess ωηο thee (because thou hast given me the victory)‚; Ι will
'sing ωηο thy name (because thou hast given me the victory) ;'' that
is--‘ Ι will glorify thee, not only by confessing the benefit with my
mouth, but also by singing and exultatione Lastly, the subject
of these effects of the victory is added :-—‘ I will confess and sing,
not among thine ancient people only, but among the Gentiles also,
gand these the most 'distant in the earth? The contest of David
‘was with Saul, by the removal of wh‘om God had given him the
victory, and fulfilled his promise3 wherefore he pledges himselfto
his God to two things ι to—‘zthe 'confess30n of J ehovah as -the one
