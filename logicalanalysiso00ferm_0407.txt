EPISTLE OF PAUL '1¹0 THE ROMANS. 365

that, in the salutation, the wife is named before her husband 3 for
Priscilla was the wife of Aquila (Acts xviii. 2): from which it
appears, that as these two surpassed the rest of those who pro-
fessed the gospel at that time in Rome3 so Priscilla, an eminent
female, surpassed her husband in the business of the gospel.
Hence, in Acts xviii. 21, she is joined with her husband in more
perfectly instructing Apollos, a distinguished preacher of the gos-
pel. “ My helpers in Christ J esus.’' He describes those who are
saluted, first, by their effects3 and then, by their adjunct. The
first effect is—‘ they helped Paul,' or ‘they were the helpers of the
Apostle Paul ;' which effect is amplified by its subject—‘ in Christ

marked. “ To whom not only I give thanks, but also all the
churehes of the Gentiles.’' Thus far Priscilla and Aquila have
, been saluted, first of all, from their effeets τ they are now saluted
from their adjunct, namely,—-‘ they are persons to whom thanks
are deservedly given? And as this adjunct flows from the fore-
going effecte, so it is presented under the form of a comparison of
majority :-‘ not only I, but moreover all the churehes of the Gen-
tiles deservedly give thanks to Priscilla *and Aquila, for their· ef-
fects‚’ viz„ those already mentioned. For if these effects are com-—
pared together, the -fortii‘er shews what they did, namely——‘ they
