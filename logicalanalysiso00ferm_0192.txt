in these words, the reason why, to the general interrogation, 116
has added a particular one concerning the evils of life, which is
taken from the adjunct of our condition in the present life, viz,
‘ that we are subject to all these evils 3' as if he had spoken or reae
soned thus :—

( In the present life we are subject to tribulation, distress, per-
secution, and the other evils enumerated3

ζ And therefore I have proposed the question—WVhether tribu-

be able to separate us from that love P’

The apostle proves the antecedent in this parenthesis by the
testimony of the Prophet, out of Psalms xliv. 22.

This is the hypophora, or subjoined reply, which, like the interro-
gation itself, is also twofold: one, in which he replies to the genc-

two ways. First he illustrates it by a comparison of majority 2——
‘ We come off, not only conquerors, but more than conquerors ς’
which the apostle asserts 011 account of the increase within us,
from our afflictions, both of a most delightful sense of the Iove
wherewith Christ loves us, and of the love wherewith we ourselves
love Him: so that the meaning is——‘ The afflictions and evils of
this life not only do not separate us from J esus Christ, but unite
us more closely, every day, in mutual love, and daily work an in·-
creasc both of a most delightful sense of his love toward us, and ..
of the love therefrom resulting, wherewith we love him in return?
“ Through him that loved us.'' Secondly, hc illustratos the reply
