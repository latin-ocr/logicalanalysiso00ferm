EPISTLE OF PAUL To THE ROMANS. 237

This love, moreover, wherewith the Israelites are beloved by
God, is explained by its cause, which is,—‘ the gratuitous electiori
of God ς’ “ Jehovah, thy God, hath chosen thee unto himself above
all the nations which are in the whole earth,” (Deut. vii. 6 3) and
this election is the cause of the love, as it is said in the same place,
(verses 7 and 8.) The election itself is then explained by its sub-
Ject, which was—‘ the fathers of the Israelites ε’

‘ God choose the fathers of the Israelites, and the Israelites them-

his own, nor of the love wherewith he loves his own, nor of that
gift which he specially confers upon his own, nor of the effectual
calling whereby he calls his own out of the world unto himself,
and causes his gifts to become known to themselves ;' or, to ex-
press the same thing in other words, ‘ election, love, effectual call-
ing, are gifts so unchangeable, that they can never afterwards be
taken away from those on whom they have once been conferred3

‘ But God chose the Israelites in their fathers, loved‚ and effec-
tually called them to be a people unto himself: ‘ Therefore the
election, love, effectual calling, and other gifts of that kind bestow-
ed by God on the Israelitish nation, continued to remain with God’
, —or, which is the same? thing, ‘ the Israelites still continue be·
loved‚ because of their election in the fathers?

From this, therefore, two things fall to be observed by us. The,
