EPISTLE OF PAUL TO THE ROMANS. 33

strated), so to be a J ew outwardly is not to be a real J ew, nor
can that properly be made a subject of glorying.

29. “ But he is a J ew who is one inwardly ;”—this is the
thesis, “ and circumcision is that of the heart :’'—he illustrates
the thesis from the like, as he had formerly done in the case of the
arsis. “ (That is) in the spirit not in the letter.'' He here de-

adjunct of the praise connected therewith3 each being expressed
by contrasting it with something distinct from it. ‘ To be a J ew
inwardly, is to be a spiritual J ew, or a J ew in the spirit, and not
in the letter? The apostle here opposes “the letter’' to ‘⁴ the

understand whatever is external and visible to every one, whether
it be natural descent or the common profession [of religion], and
participation in its external services. Therefore by the shewing
of the apostle it is the spirit and internal grace, not any thing ex-
ternal, by which he who is truly a J ew is what he is, viZ„ ‘⁶ a
J ew.'' “ Whose praise is not from men, but from God.'’ This is
the second part of the definition, and the adjunct of the praise or
commendation enjoyed by him who is truly a J ew, which is ex-
plained by contrast from its efficient cause,—‘ The praise of him
who is truly a J ew, is not from men, but from God.'

the prerogatives enumerated by the Jews, and set them aside, so

Α as to place the Jews on the same level with the Gentiles, conclud-
v ing both under sin and death. Hence the Jews rejoin‚—‘ Accord-
