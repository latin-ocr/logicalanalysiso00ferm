EPISTLE or PAUL 'ro THE ROMANS. 7 9

‘ W'herefore not as that which entered through one that sinned,
so also is the benefit.'

18. << Therefore, as through one offence guilt came upon all men
to condemnation, so through one righteousness the benefit hath
abounded unto all men unto justification of life? This is the
summing up, wherein, after having proleptically introduced a com-
parison of dissimilarity, he returns to a comparison of similarity
between Christ and Adam, and that twofold, each being fully ex-
plained by its parts. In the first of these similitudes he compares
in similar respects the transgression,* or unlawful deed of Adam,
and his first actual sin, with the righteousness† of Christ, and his
full satisfaction of the law ε for so Ι understand the term δικάιωμοι
here, as ζ the righteous deed of Christ, whereby he not only met
the requirements of the law, but also fully satisfied the law for the
transgressions of us who believe on him? This righteousness of
Christ he compares with the sin and first transgression of Adam
in the similarity of their like effects :--‘ As by the fall guilt came
upon all men, so by the righteousness of Christ the benefit of the
remission of sins has abounded unto all ς’ the similarity of these
effects being—‘ that as that guilt was to condemnation, so that
benefit of the righteousness of Christ was to the justification
(εἰς &maimo-cv) of those who are in him?

19. “For as through the disobedience of one man many were
constituted sinners, so through the obedience of one shall many be
constituted righteous.'' This is the second similitude between
Christ and Adam, whose disobedience is compared with the obe-
dience of J esus Christ in their respective effects :—‘ through the
disobedience of Adam many were constituted sinners, so through
the obedience of Christ shall many be constituted righteous.' The
passage may be thus explained3 or, if you prefer it, it may be
said that from verse 12 to this place we have a fifth argument for
the righteousness of saith, from a comparison of similarity with
