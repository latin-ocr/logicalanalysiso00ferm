gospel, so the gospel is said to be the power of God (ζ unto salva-
tion,'' to distinguish it from the ‘⁴ ministration” of the laW, since,
although the latter is, indeed, the ministration of God, and ‘⁶ glo-
rious,'’ it is, at the same time, ‘⁴ the ministration of death,” and
that whereby not salvation,—which can only be discovered from
the gospel,———but sin becomes known 3 (see Rom. iii. 20 3 and 2 Cor.

salvation,” to draw away the minds of the Romans from all their
idolatrous worship, in which, as the ministration of life and felicity,
they had formerly trusted, as the Samaritans in the arts of Simon ;
the apostle, therefore, wishes to intimate, that all that labour of

pose is drawn from the effect of the gospel, or of Christ announced
in the gospel‚ namely, ‘God's righteousness,’ the same which is
the proximate cause of salvation. The argument runs thus :—

‘Whatever reveals God's righteousness is itself the power of
Grod unto salvation3

‘ But God's righteousness is revealed by the gospe13

‘ Therefore, the gospel it'self is, to men, the power of God unto
salvation? ·

By “righteousness,'’ I here understand that righteousness by
which men are righteous before God, which is called “ God’s right,-
