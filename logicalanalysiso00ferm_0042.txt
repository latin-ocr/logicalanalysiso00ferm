xxxvi TRANSLATOR’S PREFACE.

version of the New Testament, and that by J unius and Tremel-
lius of the Old, the reader will not be surprised to find that the
Scripture quotations do not always tally with our own version3
where, as sometimes happens, the chapter and verse are different,
those of the English version have been added within brackets.
With the punctuation and division of sentences Ι have taken
greater liberties. Finding that the former was of the most
wretched description, Ι have everywhere pointed in such a manner
as seemed to me best calculated to elucidate the sense3 and have
not scrupled to break down inordinately long sentences into shorter
ones, or to group smaller ones together. VVherever the words of the
Greek text introduced into the original were accompanied by a
Latin version, they have been allowed to retain their places in the
Translation, included within brackets3 in other cases, they have
been turned into English, and the words themselves, at least on
the first occurrence of the same term or phrase, given at the bot-

tom of the page.

P.S.—I ought perhaps to have noticed the word “ disparat& in its
proper place. This term is variously used and defined by differ-
ent writers. According to some, “disparates” are-—‘ things so
unlike that they cannot be compared together ς’ according to
others, they are—‘ different species under the same genus :’ but
Cicero and Quinctilian employ the term in the sense of ‘ negative-
opposite,' (disparata, ut ‘ dura’ ‘non duris! Quinct. Inst. Orat.
Gernh. V. 11, 31.) It is in the last acceptation that it is com-
monly used by Mr Ferme.
