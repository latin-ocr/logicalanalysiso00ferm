96 LOGICAL ANALYsgs or THE

gone, are uttered in the apodosis‚ and our death put for the death
of the law3 yet the similitude from the law holds good, because a
marriage is dissolved by the death of either of the parties.

3. “ So then, if, while· her husband liveth she become another
man's she shall be called an adulteress3 but if her husband be dead,
she is fiee from that law, so that she is no adulteress, though she
become another man's.'' In these words he proves the protasis—
ί that a woman is subject to her husband only while he lives‚' and
reasons from the effect of the law of matrimony, illustrating this
effect by a contrast :—

“ that we should bring forth fruit unto God.” '

5. “ For when we were in the flesh, the sinful affections, which
were through the law, prevailed in our members‚ to bring forth*
fruit unto death.'’ This is an illustration of the latter fluit or
end, from a comparison of similarity3 of which comparison the
protasis is —‘ when we were under the law we brought forth fruit
