EPIsTLE OF PAUL To THE ROMANS. 305

as God taught the ancient Church also, by his prophet Ezekiel,
(chap. xvi. 5); and further, that we are ‘ in disgrace,’ as he inti-
mates in the same place: both of which are ‘true of us naturally,
and as we are under sin3 for the justice and anger of God, and the
consequent threatening of the execution of his just anger and judg-
ment, are all against us by nature (τῇ φυσει), from which nothing
but dishonour and disgrace can procecd. By this injunction the
apostle recommends us, in the second place, to put on Christ,
as well against external injuries, as to ward off dishonour3 both
of which the Lord J esus Christ effects for all those who put him
on. For, in the first place, he has both satisfied the justice, and
appeased the anger of God, and subdued our foes, both angels
and men, whoever would execute the anger of God upon us·—
yea, all the judgments which were justly due against us, having
been transferred to himself, he has taken out of the way, (Isa.
⁷ liii. 5) 3 and has thus rendered us safe against the evils that
threatened us. Secondly, as he himself is glorious, so he glorifies
those who put him on, and will fully glorify them on “ that day.’'
This, therefore, is the first part of the habit of light. The second
is—‘ the laying aside of the care of the flesh,’ whereby Christians
strip themselves, as it were, of the flesh; for to be clothed with
Christ and the fiesh at the same time is both impossible, and, if it
were possible, would neither be safe nor honourable to him who
should put them on. He who wishes, therefore, to be clothed with
the habit of light, so as to put on Christ for defence and glory,
must put off the flesh, as that which brings disgrace, and is accom-
panied with very many judgments. ‘ To put off the flesh,’ the
apostle defines to be--‘ so to lay aside the care of the flesh, as by
no means to desire to fulfil the lusts thereof3 nay rather, to striv'e
against ,the flesh, in order that we may walk in the* Spirit ε’ for ‘rto
fulfil the Iuste of the flesh,' is—to “ walk after the flesh,'' (κατ-ὀὶ
avignon.) ‘ to do whatever the flesh desires should· be done 3’ these
two, the spirit and the flesh, being contraries, and coveting con-
trary things, (Gal. v. 17.) 'Although, therefore, the remains of
the flesh', opposing the Spiris„ Sui-vive in the'children'of grace, οι·-
