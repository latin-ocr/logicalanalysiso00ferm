204 LOGICAL ANALYSIS OF THE

definition of the people of Gom—⁶ the people of God are those
whom he foreknew3 and God has not east away this his people.'
By this the apostle would teach us that the true Chureh of God,
which is also the people of God, is to be defined from God’s fore-
knowledge, and the other “ gifts without repentanee''* which follow
his foreknowledge and attend upon his Church (see above, ohap.
viii. 29, 30.) Whence it follows that the people or Church of
God, in its essence or in itself, and in so far as it is the Chureh of
God, is invisible, as the apostle intimates (ehap. ii. 29), when he
asserts-‘ that he is not a J ew who is one outwardly, but he who
is a J ew inwardly 3’ the reason of which is, that the foreknowledge
of God, and the rest of that grace, “without repentanee,” which
he bestows upon his Chureh and whereby it is defined, is invisible.
The Church being, therefore, in itself invisible, is rendered visible
by external ministration, for ⁴ to it were committed the oracles of
God’ (see above, chap. iii. 2); then by its effeots, as our Lord
teaches us, Matt. vii. 16‚—“ from their fruits ye shall know them.’'
“ Know ye not what the Scripture saith concerning Elijah ?”
The second argument by which the apostle proves ‘ that God has
not east away his people,’ is taken from the similar example of the
days of Elijah, thus 3-

‘In the days of Elijah, although Israel apostatized, yet amid
the common apostacy of thewmultitude, seven thousand were pre-
served who did not apostatize :

‘ Therefore, in like manner, at this time also, although Israel is
become rebellious and a people speaking against God, yet there is
a reservation of God’s elect?

The antec-edent of this enthymeme, or protasis of this similitude,
is established by the testimony of Scripture which was known even
to themselves, and consists of two parts. ‘⁴ How he intercedens
with Grod against Israel, saying.” The first part of the protasis,
viz, the complaint of the prophet speaking against Israel, and tes·
tifying concerning the apostacy by the Visible Church, is contained
in this verse.
