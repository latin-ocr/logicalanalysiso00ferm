faith.'’ By ‘ the teacher' Ι understand ‘ him who, with simplicity
and honesty, interprets the word, as the knowledge of it is pre-
served in the Church3 and by ‘the pastor’ ‘him who addresses
the Church, according to the known principles of the word, in ex-
hortation, admonition, reproof, &Q (for all these are here, by sy-
necdoche, included under the term “ exhortation,”) and therewith
combines for the further consolation of the Church, the adminis-

that distributeth with simplicity 3 he that presideth with diligence;
he that sheweth mercy with cheerfulness.’' He now illustrates the
second particular of the induction, or “ the ministry,’' * both by a

“ those who shew mercy,’' that is, ‘ who relieve the wretched,’ and
whom the apostle, in the passage quoted from the epistle to the
Corinthians, calls “ helpers ;” 'under which title I understand, not
private Christiane contributing of their own substance to the re-
lief of the poor, for the apostle is here speaking of those who have
charge publicly in the Church 3 but by “ those who shew mercy,'?
I understand here—-‘ those who, having received the alms of the
Church from the guardians of the* Church treasury, apply them to
benefit of the afflicted poor, especially those who are labouring una
