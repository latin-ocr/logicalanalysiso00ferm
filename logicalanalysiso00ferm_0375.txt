EPISTLE or PAUL To THE ROMANS. 333

“let not him that eateth, make light of him that eateth not3 and
let not him that cateth not, condemn him that eateth.’' “ For his
good.'’ This is an epanorthosis of the conclusion :—‘ Christians
ought to be zealous to please one another3 not however in every
thing, but only in those things which are for the good of those
whom they please? ‘⁴ To edification.'’ This is a definition of the
“ good '⁹ which ought to bc present to the minds of Christians in
pleasing others 3 it is—‘⁴ good to edification,’⁷ i. e., ‘to the edifica-
tion in Christ of those whom we please.' From this the apostle
would have us to observe, in passing, that nothing is a benefit to
the Christian, nor can any good be conferred upon him, if he is
not thereby edified in Christ3 for these two things——‘ to be good
for the Christian,' and ι to serve to his edification in Christ,' are
here set forth by the apostle as co-extensive and reciprocal: what-
ever good happens to the Christian is his edification in Christ3
whence the apostle would infer and conclude, in the second place
†-‘ that nothing is good for the Christian, which is not subservient
to his edification in Christ.'

3. “ For Christ indeed pleased not himself.”⁰ This is the second
argument for the foregoing conclusion, from the example of J esus
Christ :—

‘ We ought to conduct ourselves in the same manner towards
each other, as J esus Christ conducted himself towards us;

‘ But he did not please himself, but carried our burdens alone3

‘ -Therefore we ought to bear one another’s burdens, and not to
please ourselves.’

The assumption is given in the commencement of this third
verse. “As it is written.” This is the establishment of the as-
sumption from the testimony of scripture. The written testi-
mony is adduced from Psalm lxix. 10 (9); where, after David, as
the type of the Son of God, had professed his zeal towards the
house of God, he complains that the reproaches of those who re-
proached God fell upon him, and that he himself was reproached,
through his zeal for God’s house, by those‘who despised God’s
