302 LoereAL ANALYSIS OF THE

longer Gentiles, but fellow-citizens of the kingdom of heaven, and
members of that one Church which has existed from the very be-
ginning: and that he says to them, as members of the Church—-
‘that salvation, or the kingdom of heaven, is nearer at hand to
them than it was to their ancestors in former times 3' meaning by
‘ ancestors,’ not the Gentiles from whom they were deseended, but
believers under the law, and before the law, whose children they
were through saith, as the apostle himself affirms, addressing the

Galatians, who were Gentiles equally with them—“ whosoever are

›gospel ; whence the apostle thus reasons :--

‘ If the time of your ignoranee has so gone by, that nothing¹ but
*the remains of that ignorance is left3 and if you have been so illu}-
-minated with the knowledge of God in Christ, that the gospel-day
‘has clearly risen upon you, and that the day of your salvation is
-near—it follows that it is now time for you to awake from the sleep
of sin, and to repent3
