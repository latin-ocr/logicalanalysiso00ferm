208 LOGICAL ANALYSIS oF THE

being affirmed, the other is denied, and, on the contrary, either be-
ing denied, the other is affirmed. Whence it follows, according to
the apostle, that if work be reckoned the cause of life and right-
eousness, grace must of necessity be set aside, because that life
will be a reward from debt on account of merit, not a gratuitous
gift to the undeserving 3 and, on the contrary, if grace be reckoned
the cause of life, all the merit of every work must be set aside, be-
cause life is from grace, and a gratuitous gift bestowed on the un-
deserving, not a debt from the merit of works.

7. ‘⁶ What, therefore.’' Thus far we have had the first part of
the reply to the objection brought forward at the commencement
of the chapter, the apostle denying that God has rejected his peo-
ple. This negation is here embellished with a rhetorical consulta-
tion. For, first of all, the apostle introduces his opponents still
plying him with the question,—“ What therefore ?'' as much as to
say,——-‘ What, therefore, do you reply to the objection ?’ “Israel
hath not obtained that which he seeketh for.” This is the hypo-
phora or subjoined reply of the apostle to the preceding question
of his opponents, and the second part of the reply to the objection.
In this reply he first of all admits the rejection of Israel, or the
people of G0d3 which must be understood of Israel according to
the flesh only ε for, as there is one J ew who is a J ew outwardly,
and another who is a J ew inwardly, (chap. ii. 28, 29‚) so there is
one Israel in the Spirit, and another in the fiesh only, such as the
great majority of that people were in the time of Paul, and are
still3 consequently, he gives the name of ‘Israel’ to those who
were rejected, and says,-—‘ thatIsrael has not obtained that he
was secking, viz, righteousness, and life from righteousness. He
then replies most appositely to the objection by a distinction.
“ But the elect have obtained it‚’'—this is the first member of the
distinction3 “ and those left have become callous,’'—the second
member of the distinction. Here observe‚ in the first place, that
as the apostle divides the Jews into him who is a J ew inwardly,
and him who is a J ew outwardly, (chap. ii. 28, 29,) and the seed
