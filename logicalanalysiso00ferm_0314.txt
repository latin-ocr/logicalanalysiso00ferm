272 LOGICAL ANALrsm or THE

10. Thus far we have had the foundation of Christian duty—-
“love unfeigned.'' Thus far also we have had the proposition,
consisting of two members: (1.) ‘to abhor that which is evil ;'
(2.) ‘to cleave to that which is good.’ Next comes an explication
of the proposition, in which, although the law of God, contained
in the Decalogue, is as a lamp to the feet of those who have em-
braced the gospel, yet the apostle, in enjoining duty, does not pro-
ceed precept by precept, or according to the order of the com-
mandments of the Decalogue, but takes up the tables, and imposes
duties on the Christian Church, as the tables of the law require.
These duties are of two kinds3 some which are common, without
any special relation or respect, from this verse, as far as verse 13;
others with special relation or respect, from verse 13, to the end of
the chapter. The injunctions of the former kind are threefold;
those which come first, in the lOth verse, respect the second table
of the law 3 the next, in verse 11, respect both tables3 and the
last, in verse 12, the first table.

The absolute injunctions, or injunctions of the first kind which
respect the second table of the law, are two; just as the duties
which the second table of the law recommends to the people of
God are twofold 3 for the second table enjoins those things which
are due to men in the Lord, and that, indeed, in a twofold man-
ner, either generally, by every one to every other, or particularly,
what any one ought to perform to another, according to his rank
and condition. “ In brotherly love be kindly affectionate one to²
another.'’ This is the first injunction which respects the second
table of the law, comprising in a few words, and as it were in the
form of an abridgement, the latter precepts of the second table,-
concerning that zeal for life, virtue, property and reputation, which:
every one should affectionately so cherish in himself towards ali-
other, of whatever state or 'condit-ion, as to abstain from the con-
trary appetite or desire. And the apostle points to that common
brotherhood which all who have embraced the gospel have in
J esus* Christ, as the foundation of this injunction; for there is this
difference between the love of the law and that of the gospel,
