Ems'rm OF PAUL To THE Romi-ms. ‘209

of Abraham into the children of the flesh, and the children of the
promise, (chap. ix. 7, 83) so he divides the Israelites into “the
elect,'’ and “those left.'’ By “ the elect ” are intended—‘ those
whom, along with Jacob, before they were born, or had done any
thing good or bad, (chap. ix. 11, 12, 13,) [God] chose to be con-
formed to the image of his Son‚’ (chap. viii. 29 z) by “those left ”
he means—‘ the reprobate, who, being without election, have been
left behind to sin and death? Observe again, that in the first
member of the distinction, the apostle does not say that ‘the elect
have,’ but that ‘⁶ the election has obtained it 3⁹⁹ for such is the
force of the expression in the original, (ἦ δὲ ἐκλογὴ ἐπέτυχεν ς) and
he speaks by metonymy on purpose, in order to teach us that the
cause of our righteousness and life is neither merit nor faith in the
elect themselves, but is in God, viz. his election of them before
the world was. Ι would have you observe, in the third place, that
in the second member of the distinction, he does not say that
‘ those left have not obtained it,’ that is, ‘ have not obtained life,
but that they “ have become callous 3⁹³ and that with a view to teach
us two things. First, he would teach us that the wicked are not
punished with death until they have deserved it by sinning. Se-
condly, that the wicked, by sinning, contract such a habit of sin-
ning, that at length they rush into sin without remorse, and
become hardened in heart against every admonition whereby they
are invited to return to a better life. This is expressed by the
metaphorical ἐπακ-ἐπωρώθησαν, “they have become eallous ;” for
πωξος, 01· ‘callus,' is a white, hard, dry substance, whereby broken
bones are united, which grows upon the body contrary to nature,
like hard skin, and is so hurtful to the joints or lungs, that they
become unfit for their natural motion ε’ by the word ἐπωρώθησαν,
therefore, something similar in the wicked Jews, whereby they be-
came so hardened, as to be unfitted for every motion of the life of
- God, and for every good work, is intended.

8. “ According'as it is written.'' In the three following verses
- ·he both proves and amplifice the latter member of the distinction,
