200 LoechL ANALYSIS oF THE

The first objection is to this effect: ‘Israel has heard’—this, as
being obvious, is urged in the form of a question—‘⁴ Have they,’'
the Israelities, ‘⁴ not heard ‘?”

‘ Therefore, if saith is from hearing, and invocation unto salva-
tion from faith, the Israelites also, believing, will be among the
number of those who invoke the name of the Lord, and shall be
saved? “ Yea, truly their sound hath gone forth into all the earth,
and their words into the ends of the world.” To this first objec-
tion a twofold reply is given by the apostle. The first is expressed
in these words, in which the apostle not only grants the foregoing
antecedent—⁶ that the Israelites have heard,' but also proves it by
the testimony of the prophet, cited from Psalm xix. 5, (4.) This
testimony may be explained in two ways 3 either as above, chap. i.
20, concerning ‘ the knowledge of the invisible things of God ³*
from the things which he has created,’ of which knowledge the
prophet spoke3 or, we may understand the apostle as here com-
paring the preaching of the gospel by those whom God has sent
to preach, with the common preaching of created things, namely,
—‘ that as created things, ever since the creation, have preached
God to the whole world, in order to leave all without excuse,† so
now the apostles sent forth by Christ, have preached the gospel to
the whole world, in order that the elect of God may be brought to
faith.' In whichever of the two ways you explain the testimony,
the argument of the proof is from the less, thus :—

‘ The whole world has heard concerning God, either through the
preaching of created things from the very beginning, or through
the apostles, now that the gospel has been revealed τ

‘ Much more, therefore, the J ews—to whom the oracles of God
have been committed from the beginning, and to whom first it be-
-hoved that the gospel should be preached--have heard concerning
him?

The second reply of the apostle is a negation of the consequence,
which ‚he here passes over in silence, with that same prudence
which we have often had occasion already to notice3 but chiefly
