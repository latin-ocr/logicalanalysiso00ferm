which is excessive, is manifest-ed 3 and that the extreme malignity
of sin is manifested by his teaching in this way, because his teach-
ing shews that sin produces evil out of good, that is, work for us
both every sort of sin, and, in fine, death, by occasion of the law.

14. “ For we know that the law is spirituah but I am carnal,
sold so as to be made subject to sin.'’ The apostle here proves
the foregoing reply, and both members of the contrast 3 first—
‘ that the law is not death or the necessary cause of death 3 ' then
—-‘ that original sin is death or the cause of death? The argu-
ment for the former is borrowed from the nature of the law.
‘ That which is spiritual is not death or the necessary cause of
death?

‘But the law is spiritual:

‘ Therefore, the law is not death, or the necessary cause of death.⁹

The argument for the latter is taken from our own nature, such

‘ But we, ever since the fall, are carnal, and sold,'—as the apostle
explains it‚—‘ so as to be made subject to sin:

‘Therefore, sin is death to us? .

Or, if you prefer to unite the proofs of the two members of the
contrast, the argument may be said to be drawn from a comparison
of dissimilarity between ourselves and the law, in this way :—

‘ If the law be spiritual but we carnal, it is not the law, bu't the
flesh within us which is become death, or the cause of death to us3

‘ But the former is true‚’-for the apostle here proves it by an
appeal to common experienee,—‘ we know ;’ that is, ‘ we are taught

by experience that the law is spiritual, but that we are carnal, ex· x

pressing the latter by synecdoche, in his single person, to avoid
the provoking of the flesh in others3 whence he would conclude,
‘ that ‘the law is not death to US, but the flesh which is in us, by
occasion of the law,' as he has formerly said3 01· ‘ that the law is
for death to us,‘ as he spoke in verse 10, ‘only by accident, and
