210 LOGICAL ANALYffls oF THE

viz—⁴ that those Jews left behind by election have become cal-
lous.’ The proof is drawn from the written word⁷ for the apostle
speaks thus—-“ According as it is written.” And in the same way
most proofs of the New Testament are adduced, both by Christ
and his apostles3 for in John, verse 39, our Lord appeals to the
written word—“ Search the scriptures :' and in Acts xxvi. 32, the
apostle professes before Agrippa, in the presence of a numerous
assembly, that he said and taught nothing in the preaching of the
New Testament, except those things which Moses and the pro-
phete, in the written word, had foretold should happen. “ God
hath given them a spirit of deep sleep.’' Three scripture testi-
monies are adduced to prove the hardening of the Jews: of these
this is the first, from Isaiah xxix, 10. “Eyes that they should

not see, ears that they should not hear :'' this is the second tes-
timony, from Isaiah vi. 9.

= 9. and 10. “And David saith,'’ &a This is the third testimony

ἡ from Psalm lxix, 22, 23. These testimonies prove two things:
(1.) that the Jews have become callous 3 (2.) that those who have
become callous are left behind by election 3 for God does not give
a spirit of deep sleep, 800„ to the elect. The spirit of God, there-
fore, thus reasons :—

‘ Those to whom a spirit of deep sleep has been given by God
become canons, and are hardened thereby :

’ ‘ But God gives a spirit of deep sleep, ἄπα, to those Jews that
are left behind7’ as appears from the testimonies that have been
adduced ε

‘ Therefore those Jews that are left behind have become callem,
and ⁴have been hardened.' The latter member of the distinctionis
thus proved in these three verses3 in the same verses it is als'o
amplified by the apostle‚ partly by a definition of the hardening
(τοῦ πωξῶσθαι); partly by its efficient cause, and partly by the
adjunct of the time. The definition and cause are both sufficiently
obvious in the testimonies by which the hardening is proved.
