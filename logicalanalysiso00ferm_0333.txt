EP1sTLE OF PAUL To THE ROMANS. 291

‘ W hosoever is the minister of God for good to the Christian,
to him the Christian should be subject, or should subject himself ;

‘ But the magistrate,’ says the apostle to the Christian, ‘ is the
minister of God to you for your good ε

‘ Therefore you should be subject, and should subject yourself
to him of your own accord.’

To this argument the apostle passes on, in this third verse, pro-
leptically, and by anticipating what might be urged as an objec-
tion by the Christian 3 the objection is to this effect :—

‘ I cannot subject myself to himself who is a terror 3

‘ The magistrate is a terror :

‘ Therefore I cannot subject myself to the magistrate?

To this objection the apostle replies, in the beginning of the
verse, by making a distinction in the assumption, viz. :—‘ that it is
true the magistrate is a terror to evil deeds, or to those who do
evil,’ which is the one side of the distinction3 the other is—‘ that to
good deeds, or to those who do good, the magistrate is nota terror?
From this the apostle, turning as it were to the Christian, deduces,
so to speak, a hypothetical corollary z—there is no reason why you
should be afraid of the magistrate, if you do that which is good ;’
and this he proves by the contrary :——-

“ If you do that which is good, you shall obtain praise from the
magistrate:

- ‘ Therefore, if you do that which is good, there is no reason why
you should be afraid. of the magistrate?

4. “ For he is the minister of God to thee for (thy) good.” This is
the assumption of the syllogism, or second argument. “ But if,'' &m
From the assumption he deduces, as before,a· hypotheticalcorollary:
-„-‘if you do that which is evil, be afraid of the magistrate? “For he
beareth ,not the sword in vain.” We have, in these words, the reason
,οἳ the corollam, and of the dread which the evil-doer has of the magis-
trate, from the end of the magistrate's appointment rendered vain 3⁴*-
· ·‘ If the evil-doer were not afraid of the magistrate, the magis·
trate would bear the sword to no purpose and· in vain5
