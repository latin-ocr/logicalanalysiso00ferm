EP1s'an or PAUL To THE ROMANS. 255

dom of the flesh,’' as the apostle calls it, c. viii. 7—just as the
external actions of the body, the words, the affections of the
beart, and the will itself—-is enmity against God, and is wise after
the old man, until it be renewed by the Spirit. Hence also the
leading principle* of philosophers, whereby purity is ascribed to
the mind of man, even in his natural state, in tlte layin9 down of
mles, and also the freedom of choice of the Pelagians, Papists, and
Semi-pelagians, are refuted3 for if the mind itself must be renewed,
there is in man neither a mental light which is free from sin, nor a
voluntary choice which is not subject to sin. Notice, in the second
place—that, while the apostle here bids us ‘be transfigured and
transformed,' or ‘ transfigure and transform ourselves,' yet he does
not ascribe to us any power or ability, either to transform, or not
to conform ourselves to this age, all power for our reformation
being from the Holy Spirit3 but the apostle exhorts us for two
other reasons. He exhorts us, in the first place, that he may stir
us up to a devout use of the means employed by the Holy Spirit.
Thus, the Holy Spirit renews us through the ministry of the word,
and, therefore, the apostle excites us, by these exhortatione, to a
frequent attendance upon the ministry of the word, in order that
we may be renewed thereby. Secondly, he exhorts us, because
the very exhortation itself, when it has seemed good to the Holy
Spirit to work through the medium of exhortation, is “the power
of God‚'’ or ‘his powerful and effectual instrument’ for renewing
us. To these reasons we may also add a third, viz.—-that the
apostle exhorts us to renew ourselves, although that is the work of
God alone, in Christ, through his Spirit, in order to stir us up to
co-operate with God for the accomplishment of that work, accord-
ing as it is written—‘ to him that asketh it shall be given, and to
him that knocketh it shall at length be opened.' We should ob- ⁷
serve here, thirdly—that, according to the mind of the apostle,
the Christian sacrifice, or that which, in the preceding verse, he
has commanded us to offer “ living’' unto God, is made up of two
-parts3 the one consisting in our reformation, or the renewal of our
