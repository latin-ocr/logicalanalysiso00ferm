EPISTLE OF PAUL To THE ROMANs. 147

three are here enumerated as so many species of opposition, none
of which shall prevail against the picus, and those for whom Christ
was delivered up to death. Those who oppose themselves to, and
are the adversaries of the picus, oppose themselves in three ways,
either by accusing, condemning, or executing. The first species
and part of this opposition, therefore, is, ζ accusation,' and is con-
tained in verse 333 the second, ascending by auxesis,* or by a
climax, is ‘ condemnation,’ in verse 343 the third is the ‘ execu-
tion' of the other two, both accusation and condemnation, and
consists in our separation from the love of Christ, being contained
in the 35th and following verses. Each of these parts is embel-
lished by anacoenosis. The interrogation of the first anacoenosis
is, “ Who shall bring charges against God's elect ?” The hypo-
phora of this interrogation, which is omitted, or, as we said, [of
the last example of this figure], implied in the question itself, is
this, ⁶ that no one shall bring charges against God's elect,’ the
import of which, in like manner, is not that there is no accuser of
the brethren, or of believers,-—for the devil† is so named from this
very effect, and is denominated ‘⁴ the accuser of the brethren,'' in
Rev. xii. lO,—but the meaning is, ‘ that although there be many
who accuse God’s elect, yet the accusation of none, whether angels
or wicked men, shall prevail against the elect? ‘⁶ It is Grod that
justifieth.'’ This is the proof of the foregoing reply, ‘ that no ac-
cusation shall prevail against the elect,’ taken from the contrary,
viz, ‘ the justification of God,’ and runs thus :—

‘ No accusation of any one bringing charges against those whom
Grod justifies, shall prevail3

‘ But God justifies the elect:

‘ Therefore no accusation shall prevail against the elect?

34. “ Who is he that condemneth ?'’ This is the second part of
the conclusion, and the second species of opposition, embellished

· in like manner by anacoenosis, >and the answer to which is also

*¹ Amplification. † Greek, διάβολος, from διαβαλλω, ‘ to accuse?
