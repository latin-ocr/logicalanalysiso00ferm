EPISTLE OF PAUL TO THE ROMANS. 77

farther than to the actions, and that corruption of nature itself is
a transgression of it: otherwise it would be unjust that infants
who cannot sin actually should die. “Who is a type of him that
was to come,’' that is—‘ Adam was a type of Christ,’ only, how-
ever, in the respect already mentioned, that as sin and death come
through Adam, so do righteousness and eternal life come through

J esus Christ: and this is the abridged similitude, and the second
way of stating the comparison.

15. “ But not as the offence, so also (is) that which (God) freely
bestows.’' The second comparison by which the apostle illustrates
the leading conclusion is one of dissimilarity, and is twofold. The
first dissimilitude is between the fall and grace—‘ not as the fall
so also is that which God freely bestows.' By ‘⁶ the fall,” he
means the first actual sin of Adam t ‘⁴ gracess' or “ that which God
freely bestows,’' is explained by the apostle himself in the words
immediately following to be the donation or ‘⁶ gift of God,⁷’ (as
Christ speaks, John iv.) whereby, through the grace of God‚ the
one man J esus Christ is given to us and unto death on our acccunt.
“ For if by the fall of the one many be dead, much more the grace of
God, and for that is' (as appears from what has already been remark-
ed—that this grace of God is explained by the words that follow,
therefore, I take the particle ‘⁶ and’' here to signify ‘that is') the gift
by grace which is of the one man J esus Christ hath abounded unto
many? This is the proof of the foregoing dissimilitude from a com-
parison of inequality between the fall and grace, or J esus Christ
given by grace :—

‘ Grace is much more effectual to constitute many righteous than
was the fall to involve them in sin ; .

‘ Therefore not as the fall, so also is grace-²

16. “ For not as that which entered through one that sinned
(so is) the benefit.” The second dissimilitude is between the
effects of the fall and of grace, which are twofoldz the first3 and
those arising out of the first. The first effects are guilt and the
