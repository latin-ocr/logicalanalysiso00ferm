LIFE or FERME. xix

After his decease, the College at Fraserburgh seems to have
been suffered to fall into decay3 eclipsed, in all probability, by the
superior advantages of Marischal College, erected at the same
time in the town of New Aberdeen.* At the beginning of the
present century, there still stood at the west end of the town of
Fraserburgh‚ an old quadrangular tower of three stories‚ which is
said to have formed part of the building erected for the college, by

Sir Alexander Fraser.†

Besides writing a sketch of his Life, Principal Adamson has re-
corded his feelings of respect and veneration for his former pre-
ceptor, in three Latin poems, which, along with one in English,
also by himself, and two epigrams in Latin from the pens of H.
Wallace,‡ and William Rires, he has inserted at the end of his

† Statistical Account of scotland, vol. vi. p. 9. For the following information re-
specting 1116 traces still extant of this relic of the olden time, as well as certain tra-
ditionary reminiscences of the college, I am indebted to the Rev. A. Gruar Forbes of
Fraserburgh :—

“ The old tower can scarcely be said to be still extant. It has been reduced to a
heap, and is almost covered with soil and herbage. Last time Ι saw it there was a
couple of goats feeding on the top of it.

“ There is an old house of three stories between the site of the ruin and the town,
which I have been repeatedly told was intended to form part of the college buildings,
and to be used as dwelling-houses by the professors. This tenementis still entire, and
is occupied by several families. On the front of it there are four oblong tablets with
inscriptions,—

“Trust ye in God, for he is g00d‚-His merey is for ever,
And thank ye him for all ye have,—-For he is only giver.”

“Tradition does not seem to be correct, however, in declaring this to have formed 6
part of the projected college‚—the date is too recent3 over the door is an inscription
of an anchor, with the letters, P. W.,—J. R.,-1718.-1t is said that this stone over
1116 door was put into the building at the time of its becoming private property. But,
all things together, there does not appear to be evidence of the existence of any re-
mains of the college but the heap of rubbish already referred to. There never having
been a completion of the buildings, or an appointment of professors,—there is no tra-
dition beyond what you know from the Statistical Account of Scotland.”

ss Probably the son of Hugh Wallace, Laird of Carnoll, so frequently mentioned by
Calderwood.
