22 LOGICAL ANALYSIS OF THE

ζ It is true God has been good to thee, but it does not follow from
that that thou shalt escape his judgment 3’ and this negation of the
consequence he proves by two arguments3 the one taken from
the conduct of the wicked man-—“ thou despisest the goodness of
God ;” the other from the end of God’s goodness, which is the
wicked man's “ repentance.”

5. “ But according to thy hardness, and beart incapable of re-
pentance 3⁹³—the second argument by which he proves that the wisc
men among the Gentiles were inexcusable‚ * and would not escape
the judgment of God. The argument is taken from the adjuncts .
of God’s benefits‚ and the time afforded them for repentance, which
they despised 3 or it may be said to be drawn from the effects
partly of God in bestowing his benefits and affording time for re-
pent-auce, and partly of themselves in despising these benefits and
not repenting. ‘ Every one to whom God is good and affords time
for repentance‚ treasures up to himself wrath against the day of
wrath if he does not repent ; But God in his goodness,' says the
apostle to each of the philosophers of the Gentiles, 'affords thee
time for repentance, and thou dost not repent ε Therefore ‘⁴ thou
treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath.'’ '

The assumption is doubly illustrated. First, by the greater—-
‘ not only dost thou not repent, but what is more, thou canet not
repent,’ as is afterwards said concerning “the flesh‚'’ chap. viii. 7 3
that “ it is not subject to the law of Gofl, neither indeed can be.'’
Secondly, by the cause of this inability (ἀδυναμία) to repent,
namely, the hardness of heart contracted by long habit in sinning
against the conscience, which the apostle, Eph. iv. 19, denominates
insensibility (dm-azynum) this insensibility, as may be seen by
referring to the passage, is the effect of “ walking in the vanity
of their mind‚’'† and is, in its turn, the cause of that licentiousness
(ἀσέλγεια), by which they “ work all uncleanness with greediness”3
that is, it arises, as we have said, from sinning against the con-
science, and holds so firmly in sin, that the sinner cannot grieve
