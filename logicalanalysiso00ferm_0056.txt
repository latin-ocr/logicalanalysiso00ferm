14 LoechL ANALYSIS or THE

verses that follow. Their possession of the truth is proved by an
argument drawn from its efficient cause ε

God has made manifest his truth to the Gentiles ι

Therefore the Gentiles have possessed the knowledge of the
truth of God3 or, ‘⁶ that which may be known concerning God is
manifest in them.'’

Both members of this argument are contained in the nineteenth
verse3 but by Hysterosis* the consequent stands first, and the
antecedent comes after it z only we must observe, in regard
to the words themselves, that the expression ⁴76 γνωστὸν τοῦ Θεοῦ,
signifies the knowledge of God and of his truth, as far as man,
not as now depraved, but with his nature still unimpaired, is cap-

himself by man, even in the Gentiles themselves, i. a, among them,
(Ps. xix. 1-5.) Hence in 1 Cor. i. 21, that manifestation is called
the ‘⁶ wisdom of God,” of which the apostle here says, that the
knowledge of it remained to some extent even among the Gen-
tiles, and after the fall. The apostle, therefore, affirms these two
things z—first, that God had manifested himself in his “ wisdom''
to the Gentiles, and had communicated the knowledge of himself,
so that it might be accessible to and attainable by man3 secondly,
that even the Gentiles, sensual† and depraved as they were, pos-
sessed some portion of this knowledge.

20. ‘⁴ For since the creation of the world, the invisible things

of him are perceived.'’ He proves the last-mentioned antece· ·

dent, by an argument drawn from the subjects of the manifesta-
tion: God is both known by creation,‡ even “his invisible things‚'’
“ from the things which he has created, and that ever since they
