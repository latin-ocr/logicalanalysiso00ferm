EPISTLE OF PAUL TO THE ROMANS. 31

dishonouring God through their transgression of the law, from the
testimony of the prophets 3 Isaiah iii. 53 Ezek. xxxvi. 23.

25. “ For circumcision verily profiteth if thou keep the law.’⁷

We have here a prolepsis by which the apostle anticipates the
objections of the Jews against his last accusation :—

‘ We are circumcised, and keep all the ceremonies of the law 3 ’³
(for so I take it, circumcision is here to be understood by synec-
doche of the species for the genus, as the apostle seems to inti-
mate, Gal. v. 2.);

‘ Therefore we do not dishonour God.’

The apostle replies that it does not follow, and that they reason
from that which is no cause, as if it were a cause3 for that God
is glorified, not by circumcision and the external signs of service,
but by a godly life, and the keeping of the moral law, of which
circumcision is the sacrament* Consequently, that circumcision
profits the circumcised for glorying in God and glorifying the
name of God among the Gentiles, only hypothetically and condi-
tionally, viz, if they themselves keep the law, which is the true
cause. “But if thou be a transgressor of the laW, thy circum-
cision is made uncircumcision.'' He here proves his own reply,
and the conditional use of circumcision, from what equally follows
on the contrary supposition 2-—

‘ If thou be a transgressor of the law, thy circumcision becomes
uncircumcision, and is nothing worth ;

⁴ Therefore, contrariwise, circumcision profits only if thou keep
the law?

26. “ If the uncircumcision, therefore, keep the ordinances of
the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision Ρ ”
From his last reply the apostle deduces a double inference and
a twofold secondary conclusion. Of these the first is—‘ that
uncircumcision keeping the law is reckoned for or is equivalent to

³¹² Or pledge3 i. e. to which one becomes pledged in consequence of submitting to
the ordinemne of circumcision.
