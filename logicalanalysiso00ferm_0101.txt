EPISTLE OF PAUL ΤΟ THE ROMANS. 59

rity, ‘ namely, those who are not circumcised by the circumcision
and saved in Christ his son freely, or entirely through his grace,
and not in the works of the law, through original or native righte-
ousness.’ “ That the promise may be stable’'—the second and ul-
terior end for which the inheritance is through grace :—‘ if it were
through the law and its works it would be instable, although not
on the part of God promising, yet on our part to whom the pro-
mise is made 3 nay more, through weakness and instability it
would be without strength and unable* to be fulfilled, as the
apostle shews, chap. viii. 3 ε in order, therefore, that the promise
might be stable, and able to be fulfilled, nor hindered through the
inability† of our fiesh, it was the design of God that the promised
inheritance should be through grace to the whole seed. This
establishment and confirmation of the promise he illustrates by its
subject which is the whole seed of Abraham, that*is—“ not to that
only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of
Abraham.'⁷ He explains the subject by an induction of its parts,
of which two are here mentioned z the one of the law3 the other
of saith. These are amplified by a comparison of majority, thus z
——‘ that the promise may be stable to the seed of Abraham, not
only to that which is of the law, but also to that which is of the
saith of Abraham :' whereby the apostle means to intimate, that
unless the promise were from grace it would be stable to neither
· part of the seed3 not to that which is of faith, because they would
not have the law from which to attain the promise, nor yet to that
which is os the law, because of the weakness of the law. By “the
seed of the law,’' I here understand—‘ believers under the law 3'
and by “ the seed of faith'’—‘ those who from among the Gentiles
are brought to the saith of Abraham,’ which is deserving of atten-
tion for this reason, lest any one should suppose that any man,
who is not a believer, can be of the spiritual seed of Abraham:
for the whole seed of Abraham is of faith 3 but one part of faith
only, viz, the believing Gentiles3 the other of the law also, be-
cause of the oracles of the law having been committed to them, as
