EPIs'rLE OF PAUL To THE ROMANS. 317

ance of justifying faith, or the persuasion of grace, might be
brought to a termination3 but from this passage, and a great
many others similar to it, the Church of Christ asserts that assur-
ance, in opposition to the Papists.

6. “He that regardeth the (lay, regardeth it to the Lord.'' This
is a prolepsis, or anticipation of an objection to the foregoing admo-
nition. Some might say:—‘ that in controversies concerning religion,
it is impossible for both the opposing parties to be sure that they are
pleasing God, the one in doing, and the other in not doing : this,
therefore, being impossible, that it is of no use to admonish both
him that eats, and him that does not eat, him that observes the
day, and him that does not observ-e it, to be sure, each in his own
mind, that is, persuaded by saith, that he is acting rightly, and
pleasing God—the one in eating, the other in not eating ; the one
in esteeming one day above another, and the other in esteeming
every day alike.’ To this objection the apostle, in the verse be-
fore us, replies 2—-‘ that the antecedent of the argument is false;
and that so long as the things remain indifferent, and. he who be-
lieves continues weak in faith, even he who believes in weakness
may have assurance concerning that which he believes, just as he
who is strong in saith, and. in regard to whom it is most evident
that he has such assurance 3' and he establishes his reply, in this
verse, by two arguments. The first is borrowed from the end :—

‘He who does not eat, and esteems one day above another, from
weakness of saith, as well as he who eats, and esteems every day
alike, because he is strong in faith, does or omits, whatever he
does or omits, to the Lord, that is, so that the Lord may be glo-
rified in his doing or omitting? , ’
· The second argument is borrowed from the effect of assurance
of saith, both in him who regards, andin him who ¹does not regard,
in him who does not eat, as well as in him who eats 3 which effect·

its—⁴ the giving of thanks‘:'— ’

” ‘ In regarding or eating, he who does, as well as he who omits,
gives thanks to God concerning his deed or omission :⁴
