EPISTLE OF PAUL TO THE ROMANS. 227

from ‘ being able to be eng1·afted,' to c being engraftcd, or ‘ actual
future engrafting,' would not hold good. For Gocl is able to (10
things which he neither wills to (10, 1101· 18 0101 at any time about
to do ; as when it is said in Matt. iii. 9,-(ί Gocl is able from these
stenes to raise up children unto Abraham,'’ 11111011, however, he
neither wills to do, nor ever shall (lo : but what good things he is
able to confer, these he shall confer upon his own, according to his
own good will3 wherefore, the apostle proves, from the ability of
God, that as many of the Jews as abide not in unbelief, having '
been reconoiled in Christ, shall be engrafted again into their own
root.

24. “For if thou wert eut out of the olive whioh is wild by na-
ture, and hast been engrafted, contrary to nature, into the true
olive 3 how much more shall these, which are the natural branches,
be engrafted into their own olive ?'' He goes on to prove that God
is able to engraft the Jews again, by a oomparison of their second
engrafting with that first engrafting of the Gentiles :—

‘If God was able to engraft the Gentiles into the root of the
J 0118, much more shall he be able to engraft the Jews again into
their own root3

‘ But the former is true ε

‘ Therefore so is also the latter.’

The argument here is from the less to the greater. The propo-
sition is given in the text3 and is proved by the apostle by a 00111-
· Parison of dissimilarity between the Gentiles and Jews, as also
between the engrafting of the Jews and Gentiles respectively :- ·
, ‘ The Gentiles were branehes transferred from the wild olive,
but the Jews were the* proper and natural branehes of the true
01110· and the Gentiles are engrafted into a strange 01110, con-
trary to natm-<23 but the eng-tasting of the Jews will be as that- of
the natural bra'nehes into their own olive· tree:

‘ If therefore Grod was able to engraft the Gentiles into the root
of the Jews, much more shall he be able to engi-eft the Jews them

801108 into their own root? ,
