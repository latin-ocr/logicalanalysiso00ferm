EpisrLE or PAUL To THE ROMANS. 157

ren,’ that is, ⁴ for their restoration to salvation and Christ, from
opposing themselves to the gospel by speaking against it.

⁴ Therefore I have very great sorrow because of that opposition,
whereby they both perish themselves, and are the occasion of
offence to the Gentiles that they should not believe the truth.'

The antecedent is given in the text, amplified by a definition of
those brethren for whom he wishes to become anathema, who are
here described by three adjuncts. For first. of all these brethren
are the “ relatives’' of Paul, and this relationship is illustrated by
its subject-matter 2——they are his ⁴⁶ relatives,” not according to the
spirit, as Timothy and Titus are denominated his ‘⁴ sons;'’ for they
would not in that case have furnished matter for grief, but they
are his relatives ‘⁶ according to the fiesh;” where by “ fiesh'' I
understand not ‘corruption,' as after previously in this epistle,
but ζ stock and race,' or ‘ descent from the same fathers in the
flesh.' From this the apostle leaves us to learn, that although
those who are partakers of salvation in Christ should sorrow for
all who are hastening to destruction, yet blood-relationship should
increase that sorrow the more if those who are so related to us
reject the truth and the salvation which is in Christ.

4. “ Who are Israelites.” This is the second part of the de-
scription of the brethren of Paul, taken from the adjunct of their
designation, which has its origin in the former adjunct, viz.—
‘ their relationship to him according to the flesh :’—‘I could wish‚'
says the apostle, ‘ to become anathema for my bre-thren 3 and by
my brethren I mean those who, on account of their relationship to
me, according to the flesh, are denominated Israelites, from our
common parent, Jacob or Israel.’ “ Whose is the adoption, and
the glory‚ and the covenants, and the 'constitution of the law, and
the service, and the promises.

5. “ Whose are the fathers, and from whom, as regard the flesh,
*is Christ, who is above all, God to be blessed for ever, Amen.”
