EPISTLE or PAUL To THE ROMANs. 151

and latter member of the contrast by the efficient cause of our vic-
tory in every evil and affliction3 for although we are united with
Christ in mutual love more closely every day, by our afflictione,
yet it is not our affiictions which work that increase, but it is
