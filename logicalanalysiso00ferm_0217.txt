EPISTLE OF PAUL TO THE ROMANs. 175

second amplification of the conclusion—taken from the final cause
for which God shews mercy to his own, and for which he before
prepared them to glory—has respect: this final cause is—‘ the
making known (yuchgmtg) of the riches of the glory of God from
mercy ς’ which is the ultimate end to which the glory of the elect
is referred, that glory, namely‚ whereto they were before prepared
according to the purpose of God. From this, the apostle would
have us to observe that God is indeed long-suffering and merciful
to all, even to those who are vessels of wrath3 but that towards
the elect, and those to whom he shews memy, he is not only mer-
ciful, but “rich in mercy:’' whence, throughout the Scriptures,
we find the godly praying that God would be merciful to them,
“ according to the multitude of his mercies.’'

24. “Whom he hath also called.” Thus far we have had two
arguments in support of the apostle’s second reply to that objec-
tion, which is the first and leading objection in this second refuta.-
tion, as was formerly observed in our remarks on the conclusion
of ver. 5. We come now to the third argument for the same, to
which the apostle makes a transition in the commencement of this
verse by a prolepsis, wherein he anticipates an obj ection arising out
of the preceding amplification in ver. 233 in which it has been
said—that those towards whom God makes known the riches of
his glory from mercy, are “vessels of meroy,” that is—were be-
loved before they existed‚’ as Jacob was‚. ‘and according to that
love, prepared or predestinated to glory before time :' since both
this love, and the predestination which is according to it, are
hidden and laid up in God, they afford occasion for objecting in
the following way :—-

‘ Ifsalvation belong only 'to those who, according to mercy, have.
been predestinated to glory and salvation, for the making known
(γνῶξισρν) of the riches of the glory of God, no one can be certain *⁴
of his own salvation‚ and that he shall be a partaker of that glory,
' <since both this mercy and predestination, as has been said, are
hidden ;
