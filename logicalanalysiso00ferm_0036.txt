30 IN FERMIUM EPICEDIA.

ANOTHER FUNERALL ELEGIE AND ELOGIE IN MEMORIE OF THAT
FAITHFULL SERVANT OF JESUS CHRIST,

M. CHARLES FERME.

If Learning, Graoe and Godlinesse
Could lengthen humaine life,

So soon, then, had not Atropos
Drawn forth the fatall knife,

To out the short threed of thy dayes,
Soarce fiftie yeers out-spunneâ€š

Nor should another mortall thee
in length of life out-runne.

But sith thy ghost is gone, and lest
Its little house of clay,

Let all surviving souls be sure
That here they cannot stay. I. A. P.

EPITAPHIUM.

Carolus hic situs est Fermaeus, servus Iesu,

Quo nemo vixit doctior, aut melior.
