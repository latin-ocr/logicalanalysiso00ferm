EPISTLE OF PAUL To THE Roirms. 193

lating to J esus Christ was so much talked of as his resurrection
from the dead. ‘ To have the word of faith in the heart,' therefore,
is—to believe in Christ, and ί to have it in the mouth⁷ is—to pro-
fess our faith. The apostle illustrates both the faith and the pro-
fession by their subject to which, * or object3 and by their end or
effect. The subject of the saith is—-‘ the raising again of J esus Christ
from the dead 3' that is—‘ J esus Christ himself, and the work of
our redemption in him, who died and rose again :’ the subject of
the profession—‘Jesus Christ's lordship over us 3’ which is both
different from that which he has over other creatures, on ac-

and glorious for ever. In fine, the common effect both of the
faith and the profession is—‘ salvation 3’ “thou shalt be saved,”
says the apostle3 and this salvation also presupposes righteous-

mouth, or it is the mouth wherewith we confess Christ, and which
is the subject in which of confession3 wherefore to have Christ in
the mouth is to confess that Christ J esus is Lord. The apostle
illustrates both faith in the heart and confession with the mouth
by their end or effect3 for we believe with the beart-‘⁶ unto
righteousness,” i. e. our righteousness or justification is the end and
effect of faith in our heart3 just as—“ salvation'' is the end of our
confession. Moreover the apostle caus salvation the end and effect
of confession, not because it is not also the effect of saith, but that
he may teach us that all who believe on Christ must also profess
him in order to their becoming partakers of his salvation3 so that
