EPISTLE OF I’AUL TO THE ROMANS. 247

whereby God ordinarily effects that his people should present
their bodies a sacrifice unto him3 and this exhortation, whenever
it is accompanied with apostolical authority, is of no little weight
to persuade to obedienee. Paul, therefore, thus argues here :—

( Ι, an apostle of Christ J esus, exhort you, by my authority as
an apostle, to present your bodies a sacrifice to God :

‘ T herefore, do you present your bodies to God as a sacrifice!

“ Bretln·e11.” The second argument of exhortation is drawn from
a participation in common grace, which the apostle indicates by
the common brotherhood subsisting betwixt himself and them3 for
whoever are brethren in Christ, are at the same time, also the sons
of God in Christ, “ and if sons, also heirs, joint-heirs with Christ,''
and partakers in him of common grace: in styling them—“breth-

place, the apostle means—‘ the very tender affections of God, as of
a most loving father, to speak anthropopathieally, towards us, who
have been reconciled to him in Christ, and all proceeding from the
divine merey ε’ for so the Psalmist defines the compassione of God,
in Psalm· eiii. 13, when he says, that—-“ like as a father pitie'th his
children, so J ehovah pitieth them that fear him.’' This, therefore,
is the third argument for the allegorieal proposition, whereby he
persuades them to present their bodies as a sacrifice to God. The
argument is taken from the end, thus :—‘ present your bodies as a
sacrifice to God, by the compassions of Godjthat is, ‘ that it may
be made manifest both to your own consciences, and to others in
the Church, who are the children of God’s mercy, that you are
partakers of these compassions ς’ or it may be said that the argu-
