who teach3 illustrated, first of all, by a contrast, or if you please,
by the contrary: for ί( to be wise unto sobriety,’⁷ and “ to be wisc
more than one ought,” are contraries, although here distinguished
by the marks of a contrast—“ not (this),'’ “but (that.’') The in-
junction‚ therefore, here given to those who teach is this-⁴ let
those who teach in the Church be wise with sobriety, and not
more than they ought.’ The excess of ‘ being wise,’ (τοῦ φρονεῖν)
which the apostle here prohibits‚ is not the excess of the gift itself,
as if more of the gift of wisdom were given to any one than ought
to be given3 which was the mistake of Festus, and the objection
wherewith he encountered Paul—‘⁴ Paul! much learning doth
drive thee mad’' (Acts xxvi. 24): for the gift of wisdom, like all
other gifts, is given to every one by the spirit of Christ (1 Cor.
xii. 11), who gives to each according to his own good-will, and
whose will is the rule of just measure, so that neither excess nor
defect can be detected in his gifts, which are given in due measure,
with respect to the recipient3 and, hence, the gifts which are here
said to be ‘given to every one according to the will of the Spirit
of Christ,' are elsewhere said to be given÷“ according to the mea-
sure of the gift of Christ'' (Eph. iv. 7), to teach us, that the Spirit
gives to every one in the measure that is due. This excess, there-
fore, is notin the gift, but in the estimation of ambitious man, arro-
gating to himself more than he ought, and that, indeed, variously.
For some arrogate to themselves a wisdom which they do not pos-
sess 3 as the seven sons of Sceva, who laid claim to a knowledge
of casting out devils and conjuring (Acts xix· 13, 14), although
the event shows that they had received no such knowledge (v. 15).
Others, who have really received the gift of wisdom, think that
they have received it in a lai-ger measure than they have received
it; which was the error of Aaron and his sister Miriam, when they
spake against Moses, (Nnmb. xii. 2.)—“Hath J ehovah spoken
only by Moses? hath he not spoken by us also ?” They say with
truth, indeed, that J ehovah has spoken by them, and that they
have been endowed with the gift of prophe053 but they are mis-
taken in this, that they think themselves endowed with it in an
