Ems‘rLE or PAUL To THE ROMANs. 27 5

the injunctions respecting the first table of the law3 which are
three in number: the first is——⁴ the joy of the Holy Spirit,’ of
which ‘the hope that putteth not to shame ' is pointed out as the
foundation3 the second is of ‘patient endurance,’ or ‘ patience in
affiictions3' the third, concerning ‘the prayers of faith continued
in with joy and patience? ‘ Hope ' is laid down as the foundation
of ‘joy,’ because, although already “sons,” yea, “heirs,'' yea, “joint-
heirs with J esus Christ,’' we do not yet see what we shall be3 and
although all things are ours, whosoever of us are J esus Christ’s,
nevertheless, we possess by right only, not being yet in actual pos-
session, but hoping, and that with the ‘hope that putteth not to
shame,’ that the time will come when we shall be in actual posses-
sion of all things. So long as we are here, therefore, the subject
matter of our joy is not future possession, but the hope of future
possession, as it is said, chap. v. 2—“ We glory in hope of the glory
of God.’' ‘Patient endurance in affliction’ is recommended to us,
both because affliction, or the oross, is the lot of the sons of God
in the present life3 and because patient endurance can neither be,
nor be seen, except where there is suffering in the case of him who
so endures: hence the apostle says—‘ that suffering produces pa-
tience? The third injunction is subjoined, as an admonition, to
each of the preceding, lest either joy should cause us to forget, or
affliction to lay aside ‘prayer ς’ against both of which evils Chris-
tians must be up0n their guard: for we are both ready to become
remiss in prosperity3 and in trials, we have need of the apostolic
exhortation——‘ be not afraid, in any thing, on account of those who
are opposed to you’ (Phil. i. 28), and again—‘ but let your prayers
be heard before God, continued in with thanksgiving ⁹ (Phil. iv. 6).

after hospitality.” Next come the relative injunctions, which are
twofold, according to the twofold relation¹ or respect which limita
and makes them particular: for that particular relation* or respect
involving duty has for its subject, either others, from v. 13 to v.
19 ; or ourselves, from v. 19 to the. end. The relation or respect
