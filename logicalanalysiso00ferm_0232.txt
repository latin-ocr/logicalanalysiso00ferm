190 LOGICAL ANALYsis oF THE

same time from the end of each, the apostle shews, out of Moses,
that all who seek righteousness from saith are relieved 3 since
God, without any exertion on our part, without our either ascend-
ing or descending, has done both things for us ς both sent Christ
from heaven in his own time, (Gal. iv. 4), and after Christ had
died for our sins, brought him back and raised him again from the
dead, that we might be justified through saith on him. To render
this plain, I observe, that by ‘ the bringing down of Christ out of
heaven’ here, I understand—⁴ the mission of the Son to assume
our flesh, and his death in the flesh for the remission of our sins,'
(chap. iv. last verse) ε again, by ‘ the bringing back of Christ
from the dead,' I understand—‘ his resurrection, and all his subse-
quent glory, for our justification,' as it is said in the passage just
quoted. Moreover both of these, both the descent of Christ, and
his rising again from the dead, are necessary to the righteousness
of faith 3 just as the perfect keeping of the law is necessary to the
righteousness of the law : but the apostle shews out of Moses that
they differ in this—that he who seeks righteousness from saith is
relieved from these difficulties, so that he has neither to bring
Christ down fr0m heaven, nor to bring him back from the dead3
whilst, on the other hand, the whole difficulty of righteousness
from the law falls upon him who seeks that righteousness‚ so that
he must either of his own strength keep the law without fail, or
he can have no righteousness from the law. That difficulty there-⁴
fore which remains to those who 'seek righteousness from the law
is removed from those who seek righteousness from faith3 for
God, wholly of his own mercy, and without any exertion on their
part, has removed out of their way all the difficulty of that right-
eousness, since he himself, without any exertion of theirs, both
sent Christ from heaven and brought him back from the dead.
