are in Christ ought to regard each other, on account of the love
wherewith God has regarded us all in common, in Christ J esus!
The similar example by which he persuades them to salute each
other mutually in a holy manner, is taken from the other churches
of Christ :-—-

‘The other churches of Christ salute you with a holy kiss, or
salute you with a salutation proceeding from a holy love in the
