EP1srLE or PAUL To THE ROMANS. 119

the condemnation of sin in the flesh of Christ, because that con-
demnation is imputed to us, as though sin had been condemned in
our own flesh3 so that whatever has been detracted from the
rights of the law, by our sin and transgression, is again restored
to the law. By the ‘condemnation of sin in Christ,' then, ‘ and
that on our account,' I understand—⁴ the abolishing of sin,'--
which the apostle John, 1 Eph. iii. 8, calls ‘the destruction of
the works of the devil,’—‘ and that by the satisfaction of J esus
Christ3 so that our sin being now abolished, the law has nothing
to complain of as regards us who are found in Christ Jesus? The
import of the words therefore is :—‘ The law of the Spirit, or the
spiritual ministration of the gospel proclaims and seals that God,
by sending his own Son in the flesh, has fully punished, and by
punishing has so abolished all the sins of us who believe, that the
rights of the law are fulfilled in us ; ⁹ or ζ so that the law having
been kept by him, and on our account, we are justified with the
approbation of the law,’ as was before said, 0. 111. 31. The proof
of the assumption therefore runs thus :—‘ That—by which it is
proclaimed that the Son, having been sent in the flesh by the Fa-
ther, has condemned sin in the flesh,’ that is, ‘ has abolished sin
by paying its price with his death, that the rights of the law may
be fulfilled‘ in us for whom he died—delivers me, and all who with
me are in Christ, from the law of sin and of death ; ’

“ But Christ incarnate and dying in the fiesh for the condem-
nation of sin, and that the rights of the law might be fulfilled 111
us--is proclaimed by the gospel, or law of the Spirit ε

‘ Therefore the gospel or law of the Spirit who is in Christ
J esus, delivers me from the law of sin and of death?

The assumption only is given in the text, viz., in ver. ⁴3,
and the beginning of ver. 4, illustrated in ver. 3 by oppos-
ing to it its privative opposite, or ‘ the inability* of the law 3 '
this inability or impotence of the law again, in order that
it may appear to belong to the law by accident, is explained
by its necessary cause, which is ‘ our flesh,’ or ‘ the corruption of
