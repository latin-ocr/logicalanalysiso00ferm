EPISTLE OF PAUL TO THE ROMANS. 91

where there is no law,' so ‘by the coming of the law sin is aug-
mented, and when the commandment enters, sin revives, (c. vii. 9.)
also, “ by the law is the knowledge of sin,'' (c. iii. 20.)

‘ But you are not under the law ε

‘ Therefore, neither has sin dominion over you.'

The assumption is illustrated by a oont1·ast:—-“ Ye are not un-
der the law, but under grace ;’' that is—‘ ye have been translated
into the kingdom of grace, through J esus Christ, who has fulfilled
the law?

15. “What then? Shall we sin, because we are not under the
law but under grace ‘?” We have next the anticipation of an ob-
Jection suggested by the last assumption, to which the apostle re-
plies from this place to the end of the chapter-3 and that in two
ways. First, by reJecting ‘ivith abhorrence such an abuse of grace
and freedom from the dominion of the law—“ far from it.’' For
we ought not to transgress the law because the Lord has freed us
from the law3 but inasmuch as he has bestowed upon us grace,
we should endeavour to live unto him who gave us grace 3 to take
occasion, therefore, from the removal of the law's dominion, and
the bestowal of grace, to transgress the law, is a detestable abuse
of grace, and unbecoming in those who are its children3 the apostle
accordingly expresses his abhorrence at the thought.

16. “ Know ye not that to whom ye yield yourselves servants
unto obedience, his servants ye are whom ye obey.'’ This is the
second. part of the reply, by which he proves, that we must not
sin because we are under grace and not under the law. The argu-
ments are three. The first is taken from the adjunct of the servile
condition of sinners :—

‘All who sin are the servants of sin 3

⁴ But you who are under grace, and not under the law, are not
the servants of sin :

‘ Therefore, you who are not under the law, but under grace
should not sin?
