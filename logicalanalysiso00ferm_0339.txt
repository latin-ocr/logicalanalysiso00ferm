the law even to the utmost perfecti0n‚ is not thenceforth released
from its fulfilment, so as to be no further bound to fulfil it3 since
the Christian must live lawfully at all times. Hence, therefore,
the apostle thus reasons :—

‘ Whosoever has so loved another, as to be no further bound
to love him, has so sulfilled the law, as to be no longer bound to

· fulfil the law, or to live lawfully 3

‘ But there is no one who has so fulfilled the law, as to be no
further bound to live lawfully :

‘Therefore‚ neither has any one so loved another, as to be no
longer bound to love him?

By “ the law,’' in this place, the apostle means—‘ that concern-

‘ If all the commandments of the second table are comprised in
this one commandment—“ thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy-
selfi'' then it follows, that whosoever so loves his neighbour‚ as to
be no longer bound to love him, has fulfilled the law 3

‘ But the former is true’—as appears from this induction——“ Thou
shalt not commit adultery‚ thou shalt not kill, &Q 3 and, if there
be any other commandment, (of the second table,) it is briefly com-

prised in this one saying‚ Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy-
self:”

‘ Therefore the latter also is true-⁹
The proof of the assumption is all that is expressed in the text.

10. “ Love worketh no ΞΠ to its neighbour.’' This is the second
proof of the assumption, taken from the disparate of such love, which
