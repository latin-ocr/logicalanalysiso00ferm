EPISTLE OF PAUL 'ro THE noMANs. 23

for his sin unto repentance. “ Thou treasurest up unto thyself
wrath against the day of wrath.'’ The conclusion is also illustrat-
ed by the greater, and by the adjunct of the time ε by the greater
‘ not only shalt thou not escape wrath and judgment, but through
thine impenitence and contempt of God’s forbearance thou trea-
surest up wrath unto thyself'3 by the adjunct of the time—“ the
day of wrath‚'' defined as “the day of the revelation of the just
judgment of G0d‚’' that is, as Peter calls it, “the day of the Lord,”
and of the brightness of his coming, on which his judgment against
those who now securely despise his forbearance will be revealed to all.

6. “ Who wil] render to every man according to his deeds.”
Here commences a digression in which the apostle vindicates the
justice of the judgment of God, and stops the mouths of all who,
as is usual on such occasions, utter complaints against their judge,
be they Jews or Gentiles. For, in the preceding part of the chap-
ter, the apostle has close pressed the wise men among the Gentiles,
and brought them in guilty step by step, by a sort of climax3 the
first step was,—“ Thou art inexcusable, Oh man 1’⁷ 3 the second—-
‘⁶ Thou shalt not escape the judgment of G0d”; the third—“ Thou
treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath,’' that is,
not merely wrath and judgment, but a treasure of judgment is in
store for thee: the Gentile philosopher,' perceiving that he is
amenable to such penalties, begins to murmur against that judg—
ment, as unjust, in which complaint he is joined by the J ew, the
hearer of the law: the apostle therefore, in this digression, stops
the mouths of both, and at the same time that he shuts them up
under judgment vindicates the justice of that judgment. The vin-
dication contains two arguments. The first of these is taken from
a comparison of equality between the deed and the reward or
punishment attached to the deed : Whenever the reward or punish-
, ment rendered to a man is according to his deed, that is, equal
to it, that judgment is just;

But God in his judgment renders to every man according to his
deeds :—
