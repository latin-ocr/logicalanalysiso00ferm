9. “For this is the word of promise, at this (very) time will I
come, and sarah shall have a son.” He next proves the conse-
quence of the foregoing enthymeme, by adducing, from Gen.
xviii. 10, the promise according to which Isaac was born a child of
promise, reasoning thus :

‘Isaac is a child of promise, as appears from the promise con-'-
cerning his approaching birth,—“ At this (very) time will I come,
and Sarah shall have a son :³³

‘Therefore, if all who are the seed of Abraham are not also
children, but the seed of Abraham is called in Isaac, it follows
that the children of the flesh are not the children of God, but that
the children of the promise are reckoned for the seed 3'

To this, which is the general proposition, the apostle might have ἱ
subjoined the assumption :

‘ But all who are of Israel, as their father, are not the
children of the promise,' as is plain from the fact of their re-
jecting the promise and cleaving to the law or carnal command-
ment τ

Whence he deduces his reply, as a conclusion similar to the
third, viZ. t—-‘ that all who are of Israel, as their father, are not also
the true Israel, and reckoned for the seed?

Hence, from first to last, which is the third process in the argu-
ment from the example :—‘ All who are of Abraham according to
the flesh are not reckoned for the seed, but in Isaac only his seed
is called: .

‘ Therefore neither are all who are of Israel, Israel in truth.'

The assumption of the second syllogism in this threefold process
alone is wanting, being sufficiently obvious, as we have already
observed, from the apostasy of Israel, and their rejection of the
promise, of which the opponents themselves were aware.

10. “ And not only (he), but also Rebecca, when she had con-
ceived by one, even by our father Isaac, (experienced this).'’ This

is the second example in which the apostle is more concise than in V

the former ; for, omitting both of these preliminary prodesses, as ’
