86 LOGICAL ANALYSIS oF THE

quickening of us to a new life. Observe here, thirdly, that our new
life is not a life of idleness3 for the apostle says that we must
‘⁶ walk in this new life.'' And, in the fourth place, observe that
this walk is the glory of the Christian in that life3 for as the
apostle compares our new life to the resurrection of Christ, so he

compares this our walking in a new life to the glory of the F ather,
to which Christ ascended.

5. “For if being planted, we have been joined with him in con-
formity to his death, we shall also be joined with him in conformity
to his resurrection.'' He here proves the proposition of the lead-
ing syllogism, viz.—‘ that those who are dead to sin should not con-
tinue in sin! The syllogism of the apostle is made up throughout
of hypothetical propositione, in this way :—

‘ If we have been joined with Christ in conformity to his resur-
rection, or, which is the same thino·

ὃ,
Christ, we must not continue in sin 3

if we have risen again with

‘ But if we have been joined with him in conformity to his death
or in other words are dead and buried with him (which has been
already proved,) we are also joined with him in conformity to his
resurrection ε

⁴ Therefore if we are planted with Christ in conformity to his
death, that is, if we are dead with Christ to sin, we must not con-
tinue in sin? ,

The argument is deduced from the adjunct of the inseparable-
ness of our quickening through Christ and our mortification
through the same3 which quickening is so contrary to persever-
ance in sin that the two are inconsistent, and the one being affirm-

· ed, the other is necessarily denied.

6. “ Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him that
the body of sin may be deprived of strength, that henceforth we
may not serve sin.’' The assumption of the last syllogism‚ or the
connection between our quickening and mortification through
Christ, of which we were hearing in the last verse, is here proved
