EPISTLE OF PAUL To THE ROMANS. 279

body which is opposed to the myst-isal body of J esus Christ, is
that which we have before denominated—“ the seed of the ser-
pent,’' or, as John speaks—“ the offspring ofvipers ;’' ‘ the children
of their father the devil,' and, if we may so express it--‘ the mys-
tieal body of Satan? These ean do nothing but evil to the saints,
or those who are members of J esus Christ: yet the apostle com-
mands the Christian to receive these very persons—doing him evil,
and as it were opposed to him in an opposite body—in a Christian
manner, and dutifully ε and he sets forth the duty which he wishes
to be performed towards them by meosis, viz. by forbidding the
neglect of the duty—-‘ do not render evil to those who do evil to
you ς’ instead of saying—as he might have said, and afterwards
indeed does say—‘ receive those who do evil to yOU, by doing
good to them? There is one expression, however, used in pre-
scribing this duty, which is especially worthy of remark3 for the
apostle does not say—⁴ do not render again evil for evil to the evil
or unyodly,' but eommands that evil instead of good should be ren-
dered “ to no man.'’ By this he would intimate, that it is not only
the evil and wieked who do evil to the Christian, but that even a
Christian may do evil to a Christian, and those who are members
of the same mystical body in J esus Christ may injure each other,
as David did Uriah ; the apostle, therefore, in order to extend this
duty beyond the ungodly and those who are opposed to us, enjoins
upon the Christian to render again evil for evil “to no man,’'
whether an ungodly man or a brother: and it is certainly most
agreeable to reason, that if we pardon an ungodly man doing us
evil, we should still more pardon a brother doing us injury through
infirmity.

Thus far we have had the duty to be performed by the Chris-
tian, both to those that do him good, and to those that do him evil,
separately z now follows the duty to be performed to both jointly,
which is twofold. “ Attending to things honourable in the sight
of all men-’⁹ This is the first injunction, wherein the apostle en-
joins that the Christian should conduct himself honourably in his
whole conversation and doings, so that, in what he does, he may
