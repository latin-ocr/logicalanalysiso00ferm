of the admonition is from the effect of division, or schism, in the
Church. This effect is—‘ cause of offence 3’ and that twofold:
both that whereby many weak are made to offend, or stumble3 and
that by which the truth, and the professore of the truth, are evil-
spoken of. Both these evils proceed from division ι for both the
weak, being carried away by the authors of divisione, often grie-
vously stumble 3 and those who, without having examined into the
matter, shun division, often blame even good men, and the truth,
which otherwise is irreprehensible. For it is neither the truth‚
nor those who stand up for the truth, who are the cause of divi-
sion3 but these “ authors of divisions⁹⁹ of whom the apostle speaks,
are ‘those who rise up against the truth, and, on the truth’s ac-
count, harass the professore of it.' “ Contrary to the doctrine
which ye have learned? This is the third amplification of the ad-
monition, fr0m the disparate of division :—‘ the doctrine which ye
have learned is remote from division3 and division, remote and dif-

pel of Christ ς’ which is not a doctrine of divisions, but of love:
for it teaches—both that the world has been reconciled to God in
Christ3 and that Gentiles are joined with Jews, and Jews with
Gentiles, in the one sheep-sold of Christ: so that now, under the
gospel, ‘ there is neither J ew nor Gentile, neither male nor female,
neither bond nor -fi'ee, neither circumcised nor uncircumcised,' but
all who believe are the one sheep-fold of God in J esus Christ.
This doctrine, he says—-‘ they had learned,’ and that from himself 3
for so I understand the apostle here to speak: for although the
apostle had not yet come to Rome, nor had yet preached the gos-
pel in that city3 yet almost all those who professed the gospel in
Rome, at the time when this epistle was written, had heard him,
and had been taught the gospel of Christ by him elsewhere, as
appears from the foregoing salutations. For Priscilla and Aquila,
and the whole Church which was in their house, heard Paul, both
at Corinth, and at Ephesus3 and the same conclusion holds true in
like manner of the rest, namely, that the others who are saluted by
him, had each heard'him elsewhere, and through hearing, had re-
