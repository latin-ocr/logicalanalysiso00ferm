LOGICAL ANALYSIS

OF THE

EPISTLE OF PAUL TO THE ROMANS.

ΤΗΕ Apossse, being about to proceed to Rome, sends this Epistle
on before him 3 in which it appears to be his aim and design to
prepare the minds of the Romans, by it, as by a sort of Isagoge7*
for hearing and eagerly embracing the gospel, when he himself
should come and preaeh it. He seems, therefore, purposely to
select for discussion in this Epistle‚ the position, that the yospel is
the power of GocZ zmto salvation ; that is, that the gospel is the sole
nuth, according to which God is rightly worshipped, and which
brings righteousness, peace, and eternal life to men. Having dis-
> cussed this, he, by way of an appendix or inference, exhorts to a
‘life worthy of the gospel, which is the second part of the prepara-

ἶ flou.

 

s ’ The Epistle therefore consistslof three parts ε the first as far as
ἶ chap. i. verse 16, is the Exordium3 in the second part, extending
Ᾰι to the· 15th verse of chap. xv„ the intention and aim of the
Apostle is handled, and the minds of the Romans are prepared for
ἶ4 hearing the gospe13 from chap.‘ xv. verse 15, to the end, there is a.
ἵ. lengthened and multifarious conclusion.
