ing to your opinion, therefore, Paul, there is no advantage in being
a J ew, nor in circumcision, and the law of Moses ς’ for so, by
synecdoche of the part for the whole, circumcision is put for the
entire Mosaic law. Since the Jews urge this negation from the
foregoing refutation in an interrogative form, as involving a
most manifest absurdity, the sense is,—‘ Unless you admit the
privileges which we have specified, we do not know what is
the advantage of being a J ew rather than a Gentile; or of

having the law of Moses more than of wanting it-; tell us if you
know of any?

in which the Apostle, rejecting as worthless those prerogatives in
which the Jews gloried, shews that there remains to the J ew great
advantage in every way. “For there is this chiefly, that unto
them' were committed the oracles of God.” By an instance† or
particular example, he here confirms his reply, and removes the
universal negation of the Jews. They said that if the prerogatives
enumerated were not admitted as such, then the J ew had none:
The apostle maintains, on the contrary, that besides these there
was another superior to these, and the chief one, namely—that unto
them were committed the oracles of God ; that is, as he afterwards
explains, chap. ix. 4, that their's were the promises, and ac-
cording to the promises, the adoption, the glory, the covenant, the
constitution of the law, and the service. The apostle, therefore,
withdraws the Jews from glorying in the flesh and in external
privileges that he may base both their glorying in themselves and
in their exter-nal privileges upon the prerogative of grace through
the promises; which promises he here denominates “the eracles
of God,” and as he speaks in 1 Cor. i. 31—quoting from J eremiah
--“ he that glorieth let him glory in the Lord.'’
