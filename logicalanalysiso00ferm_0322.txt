280 LOGICAL ANALYSIS OF THE

be free from blame or censure 011 the part of any man, whether in
the Church or out of the Church3 yet, at the same time, taking
care that what he honourably attends to and does, 116 should so do,
that he may be able to take his stand on the authority of the Word
of God, in reply to any one, whether good or bad, who examines
*him 3 and may proceed with confidence in the doing of it, being
ready to answer for the honourableness of what he does to any one
who requires of him an account of his conduct. I thus extend the
injunction generally3 not denying, however, that it has a special
reference to that zeal whereby a man strives to secure, either for
himself or others, the outward blessings of life : in this, especially,
the apostle commands that the Christian should be seen to be
honourable, both by the godly and ungodly3 as we find that the
apostle himself acted, from 2 Cor. viii. 21, where he defends
his zeal in making a collection through the Gentile Churches, to
relieve the poverty of the saints in J udea, (of which Agabus gave
warning, Acts xi. 28), by this very Christian duty, namely, that
in making that collection, he was attending to things honourable

in the sight of God and men.

with all men? This is the second injunction which the Christian
should observe towards both the godly, and the ungodly, jointly :—
‘ the Christian should live at peace with every man, whether godly
,01 ungodly.’ So Abraham lived at peace with the Syrian brothers,
Eschol and Aner, (Gen. xiv. 13) 3 Isaac with Abimelech; Heber
the proselyte, with Jabin3 and so Paul himself became all things
to all men, in order that, living at peace with all, he might, from
among all, gain some to Christ. The apostle, however, restricte
, this injunction about living at peace, by a twofold restrictiori,
whereby he reminds us in passing, that the present life is not the
life of our peace3 and that we shall not be able to live at peace
with all men here in a holy manner, inasmuch as our life is laid up
with God in Christ, in the heavens. The first. restriction isa—“as
