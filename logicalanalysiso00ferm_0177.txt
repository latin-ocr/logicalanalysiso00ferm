EPISTLE OF PAUL To THE ROMANS. 135

written, 1 Cor. v. 17,-“ Old things are passed away, behold all
things have become new ;'' and again, 2 Pet. iii. 13‚-“ We look
for new heavens and a new earth.'' The apostle therefore says,-
that the world being preserved on account of elect men, groans
under corruption, and is subject to vanity, longing for the liberty
of the elect, that it may be restored to liberty along with them!

21. “ In hope that itself also shall be restored.'’ This is the second
part of the condition of creation, and an epanorthosis of the for-
mer—⁴ Creation has been made subject to vanity, but in hope that ‚
itself also shall be restored.' Hope is here ascribed to created
things anthropopathically, and after the manner of men to be
saved3 to the latter the hope of deliverance properly belongs, but
also to created things metaphorically, since they shall participate
with elect men in Christ J esus in their deliverance. “ From the
bondage of corruption.'’ He explains this hoped for deliverance
of creatures from the subject termini* a quo, and ad quem† of the
deliverance. The terminus a quo, is “ bondage'' and “ corruption ;’'
i. e.—‘ miserable bondage on account of corruption, and the judg-
ment upon corruption3 in both of which created things are par-
takers along with man, while serving man in his sin? “ Into the
libert-y of the glory of the sons of God.’' The terminus acl quem is
“ liberty? which is explained, lst, by its primary subject, “ of the
sons of God;’' 2d, by the adjunct of its glory-—it is ‘glorious
liberty from corruption, and the judgment upon corruption, through
the‘righteousness of Chris& which is called “ glory,’' because it is
glorious liberty, (Phil. 111. 20, 21.) And, as it primarily belongs
to the sons of God, so, by participation with them in Christ, it
belongs also secondarily to created things.

22. “ For we know that the whole creation sigheth together
and travaileth together, even unto this time.’' This is the second
argument whereby he proves the antecedent, or that created things
