EPISTLE or PAUL To THE 00111115. 113

be pronounced by man’s own conscience during this life, or by
Christ the Lord at his coming : for the apostle, John, makes
mention of both when 110 says, 1 Ep. iii. 20-“ If our heart con-
demn us, God is greater than our beart-3 ’⁹ intimating that there
is against the sinner a two-fold condemnation7—-one of his own
heart or conscience, and another of God who is greater3 and that
the latter is more to be dreaded than the former. Against each
of these, both the stings of conscience in this life, and the fear of
being· rejected by the Lord at his coming, the apostle comforts
believers by the conclusion before us—-that there is no condemna-
tion, either of conscience in the present life, or by the Lord at his
coming, against those who 010 111 Christ Jesus.—“ Who walk not
after the flesh, but after the Spirit.” This is an epanorthosis of
the foregoing conclusion, and a description of those who are 111 J esus
Christ from their acting, amplified by a contrast of causes 3 their
acting· is,-—‘ that they walk not after the flesh, but after the Spiritl
This description and epanorthosis of his assertion the apostle sub-
joins on account of hypocrites, and those who have a “dead faith,’'
as the apostle James speaks, chap. ii. 173 that is—‘ who boast
that they are Christ's, and partakers of the redemption that is in
him, whilst they are still in sin, and consequently not in J esus
Christ ε’ 10 prevent such from deceiving themselves and others,
the apostle here says—⁴ that those are not in Christ who do not
walk in the Spirit, and that those only are believers, who, by walk-
ing after the Spirit, shew that they are really inqrafted in Christ ,·’
as the Syriac Paraphrast appears to have understood this passage
(See his version).* The apostle deduces his present conclusion,
from the constructive reasoning of the preceding discussion con-
cernin'g the righteousness of saith· in this way :—‘ To those who
are in Christ J esus, and who give evidence that they are really in
him by walking after the Spirit, there is no condemnation.’ The
proposition which the apostle omits, and which is--‘ 10 111050 who
are 'righteous there is no condemnation,’ is an undoubted axiom,
