Ems‘rLE OF PAUL To THE ROMANS. 229

trary to the genius of the gospel, (1 Cor. viii. 2,) you, who have
been called to Christ from among the Gentiles, should either be
proud 011 account of your knowledge of Christ, or should triumph
over the Jews as ignorant of him? “ That hardening in part has
happened to Israel.’' This is the assumption itself of the syllo-
gism, which, in the words immediately preceding, the apostle has
both amplified and proved. This assumption consists of two parts.
The first is this—⁴ hardening has happened to Israel in part only,'
(ἀπ-δ μέζους.) This ‘hardening in part merely,' is opposed to
universal apostacy, in the manner of inferior contraries or subal-
ternates : for the Jews were hardened, during the time of harden-
ing, not univer-sally, (καθ’ ὁλον,) but only in part3 so that the
’ elect continued unhardened, whilst those left by election became
callous, as he himself speaks in verse 7 of this very chapter, and
has proved in the first six verses, both by his own example, and by
a comparison of similarity with the times of Elijah. Wherefore,
from a comparison of this passage with that prophecy of this same
apostle concerning the future apostacy of the Gentiles, where it is
said ‘ that the day of the second coming of J esus Christ will not
arrive, except there first come an apostacy of the Gentiles also,’
the apostle wishes to shew, that even as regards apostacy itself,
the condition of the Jews is better than that of the Gentiles 3
since he predicts that there will be an apostacy of them also, and
that without even the addition of the note of limitation, (ἀπὸ
μέζους). The apostle‚ however, does not intend to intimate by
this prediction of an universal apostacy of the Gentiles, that there
-will be none of God's elect remaining among them under Anti-
christ: for when, in the same place, (2 Thess. ii.) he afterwards
predicte that Antichrist ‘ shall be consumed by the spirit ‘of
Christ’s mouth,' he certainly foretells that during the whole time of
,the darkness of Antichrist, a part of the Gentiles shall remain and
be reserved among the elect3 through means of which, Antichrist,
-in his own time, is to be gradually consumed, the flame having .
been kindled by the Spirit of God, until he be destroyed by the
brightness of the coming of the Lord himself. The comparison
