EPISTLE OF PAUL To 'rx-113 ROMANS. 121

foregoing enthymeme, is postponed to ver. 8. The other parts of
the syllogism are given in the text3 but, by hysterosis, the as-
sumption takes precedence of the proposition, the former being
contained in the fifth and the latter in the sixth verse. I regard
the proposition as tropical and expressed by a metonymy, partly
of the effect for the efficient cause, and partly of the adjunct for
the subject: 44 the wisdom of the flesh is death,’' i. e.—‘ the effi-
cient cause of death 3 ' “ the wisdom of the Spirit is life and peace,'’
i. e.—‘ produces the certainty of life and peace ς’ for the wisdom
of the Spirit is the proof and sign which seals the life and peace
which are through Christ, and is therefore a part of that life, and
the beginning of it. It should be observed that in both the pro-
position and assumption, ‘ to be after the flesh,’ or 4 in the flesh,'
is the cause of ‘walking after the fiesh 3' and to be after the
Spirit, or 4 in the Spirit,' the cause of walking after the Spirit:
but inasmuch as these causes and their effects are reciprocal, the
apostle here uses both forms of expression—viz, ‘to walk after the
flesh,’ and ‘ to be after the flesh 3 ’ and again 4 to walk after the
Spirit‚‘ and 4 to be after the Spirit,'—-for the same thing.

7. “Because the wisdom of the flesh is enmity against God.’'
‚He here proves the first part of the proposition, viZ.—‘ that the
wisdom of the flesh is death] The argument by which he proves
it is taken from the effect of fleshly wisdom, viz., ‘ enmity against
God,' which again is the cause of death 2—-

4 Enmity against God is death, or the cause of death3

‘ But the wisdom of the flesh is enmity against God, that is the
cause and source of that enmity:

‘ Therefore the wisdom of the flesh is death?

“ For it is not subject to the law of God, for indeed it cannot
be.’' In these words he proves the foregoing assumption, viz, ‘ that
the wisdom of the flesh is enmity against God,’ from the disparate
of fleshly wisdom whichis—‘ to be subject to the law of God 2⁹-—
⁴ That which is not subject to the law of God is enmity against God 3
· But the wisdom of the fiesh‚ 01· the ‘wisdom of man in the flesh
