EPIS'rLE OF PAUL To rm: noMANs. 269

included that order in the Church which, in Acts vi„ and 1 Tim.
v., is denominated the order of “ widows ;'' although the whole
order is here expressed in the masculine gender, as being one in
which males, no less than females, are required: for the affiicted
poor, especially the sick, have need, not only of widows to nurse
and watch them, but also of surgeons and physicians, and other
men of that sort, who are necessary for their comfort in their sick-
nesses. This is the subdivision of the deacons. The second am-
plification of the ‹leacons is taken from the adjunct of the manner
of ministering (διακονίας). Here, however, the adjunct of the
manner, not being common, like that of those who teach, but pe-
culiar in the case of each species of deacons, is not subjoinecl to
the genus, as we have before seen the manner of prophesying sub-
joined to the gift of prophecy, viZ„ ‘ that it should be “ according
to the proportion of faith’' (κατ’ ἀναλογίαν τῆς πίστεως); but to
each species of deacons their own manner of ministering is sub-
joined: (1.) In those who distribute, ‘⁶ simplicity’' is required3 (2.)
In those who preside, “ diligence’' in watching over the morals of
the people; (3.) In those who shew mercy, “ cheerfulness.'' By
‘ simplicity in those who distribute' I understand—‘ that integrity‚
whereby they keep back nothing which has been contributed for
the benefit of the poor 3 nor lay out any thing with respect of per-
sonS‚ but in proportion to the necessities of the recipients„ and ac-
cording to the appointment of the eldership ε’ the more so, because
this respect of persons has disturbed the Church of Christ from its
very infancy3 as we see in Acts vi. 1, where the slighting of the
Grecian widows in the ministrationis mentioned as the occasion
of the first dissension in the Christian Church. The virtue of
elders who do not teach, and their legitimate manner of minister-
ing is “ diligence ;'' and denotes ‘ their sedulous assiduity‚ or as·-⁴
siduous sedulity in attending to the morals of the people,' as those
upon whom it is more incumbent to attend to morals, 'than upon
ministers themselves, orrthose who labour in the word: for the lav,
ter are distracted from such diligence by the ministry of the word
and doctrine3 as Peter would intimate when he· says (Acts vi. 2)
