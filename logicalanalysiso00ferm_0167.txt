EPISTLE OF PAUL To THE ROMANs. 125

'‘ But your body is dead because of sin, and your life is spiritual
because of righteousness ε

- ⁴ Therefore you are not in the flesh but in the spirit?

11. “ But if the Spirit of him that raised up J esus from the
dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall
also quicken your mortal bodies through his Spirit that dwelleth
in you.” This is an epanorthosis, whereby, to prevent the saints
ftom referring what he has said concerning the death of the body,
to the destruction of the body itself and “this earthly tabernacle,'’
as he denominates it, 2 Cor. v. 1, especially as it is mortal and
perishable through the corruption of our nature, the apostle in
these words consoles them with the announcement of the resur-
rection of that same body, which, through sin, is mortal and
perishable. This resurrection of the body he amplifies by its sub-
ject and efficient cause. The subject is—-‘ those in whom dwells
the Spirit of him who raised up J esus from the dead,' that is, those
to whom belongs that certainty of salvation and freedom from con-
demnation, which the apostle is discussing in this chapter3 for
although the resurrection of the body is common to all, yet those only
in whom the Spirit of life dwells will rise again to life and glory: the
apostle, therefore, consoles with the announcement of a future re-
surrection those only to whom it will be a benefit 3 not to mention
that the first resurrection, and its increase day by day, is the
peculiar privilege of those in whom this spirit of life dwells. Thus
far of the subject. A twofold efficient cause is pointed out 3 first
in order is—‘ Grod the Father 3’ third in order is—‘ the Holy
spirit? Each of these is defined by his effect—God the Father
raised up Christ the son from the dead3 and the dead in Christ
are raised up with Christ though 'the Holy Spirit, both in this
world, more and more every day, to a new life, and, at the coming
of the-Lord, to eternal life, to each of which resurrections, through
the Holy spirit, the apostle here alludes. Of bot-h these resur-
rections also, God the Father is the author first in order, the Son,
the cause second in order, and, third in order, the Holy Spirit3
