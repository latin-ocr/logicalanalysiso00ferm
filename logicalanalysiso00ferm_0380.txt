338 LOGICAL ANALYffls OF THE

reception, which is :—‘ that as he himself is glorious, so we may be-
come partakers in him of the glory of God ;' of that ‘ glory,' namely,
⁴ which God gives, in Christ, to those whom he foreknew, in order
that he may be worthy to be admired, in the glorification of his

ψ saints, on that day? This similitude, I say, has respect, first of

all, to the stronger3 who are thereby admonished to receive the
weaker, as Christ—who, in every view, is incomparably our supe-

he employs this same argument—“ Let the same mind be in you,
which 'was also in ‘Christ Jesus.’'
