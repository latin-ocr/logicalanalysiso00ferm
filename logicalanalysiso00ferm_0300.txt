present ourselves as a sacrifice to God‚’ isssss² t‘o· b& animato God,
and transformed, by the renewal of our mind, from the form or
fashion of this age 3' and ⁴ to prove what is that holy, good, and
acceptable will of G0d‚’ is—‘ by the power of the regenerating
Spirit “ to walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit,” or ‘to
live dutifully, andin a manner worthy of the gospeL’ Accordingly,
the explication of our ‘ living, holy, and acceptable sacrifice,’ con-
sists in—a setting forth of injunctions, whereby a life worthy of
the gospel is prescribed3 all of which are based upon the authority
which he possesses through the grace of his apostleship. This ex-
position, therefore, is divided into two parts: the first containing,
by way of a general foundation, the authority of him who enjoins3
the second, the injunctions themselves of a life according to the
gospel. The authority is, indeed, connected with the first injunc-
tion, and laid down as the foundation of his injunction to those
whom he first enjoins‚ namely, the pastors in the evangelical
Church of God3 in such a way, however, that it is more than ob-
vious that it is likewise the foundation of the other injunctions
that follow, as appears from the 15th verse of chap. xv., where, at
the close of the whole, he assigns as the reason of his boldness of
speech,* and freedom in setting them forth—⁶ the grace which was
given him from God‚’† i. e., the grace of apostleship and of fidelity
therein‚ which he has received from God, with a share of fruit
through common saith.

note of regular illation· for as the apostle, in the two preceding
verses, has proposed to speak concerning a life worthy of the gos·-

that life which is worthy of the gospel. Or the particle γοὶξ may
be taken as the note of the cause 3 as if the apostle had saitis—‘I
both propose and enjoin concerning a life worthy of the gospel,
v'v'ith authority, because grace for the apostleship has been given to
me? In whatever way the particle in question is taken, whether
as illative or· musal, the word λέγω, ‘ Ι say,’ or ‘commandss is a
