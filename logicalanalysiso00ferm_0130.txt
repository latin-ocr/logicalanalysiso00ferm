88 v LOGICAL ANALsts OF THE

surety, and, in him, of us, tor whom he stood surety3 so that the
sense of the words will be :—‘ he who is dead, viz., Christ, he who
suffered for sin in his own death and passion is most justly liberated

(6231m21m001)fr0m all sin and guilt and the power of sin3 from
which the apostle deduces the proposition in the words that follow
v. 8.—⁴‘ If we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also
live with him.” In these words you will observe that the apostle
not only speaks of the new life of Christians in the present world,
but also extends the promise of life in Christ, by a comparison of

for ever: ⁴

‘ Therefore we not only live here, but shall live for ever.'

The assumption is proved in the words quoted :—

‘ Christ is risen from the dead to die no more, death shall no
more have dominion over him’—which the apostle illustrates by
our own testimony, or by the adjunct of our knowledge :

‘ Therefore neither shall we, who are risen with him, die any
more?

10. “For in that he died unto sin, he died once: but in that he
live-th, he liveth unto God.” The apostle here proves the forego-
ing antecedent, from a comparison of dissimilarity between the'
death and life of J esus Christ: which are compared in respect to
two things, viz., their object and duration :—

‘ He died unto sin, and he died once ε but he lives unto God,
and consequently for ever:
