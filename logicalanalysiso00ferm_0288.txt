1. “I exhort you, therefore,’' &a This exhortation is deduced
from his previous teaching, as a conclusion from its antecedent, or
an effect from its cause, which the apostle indicates in the com-
menccment of the chapter, by the illative particle (οὐν) “there-
fore,” to teach us 1—-‘ that a conversation conformed to this world,
and a sincere profession of the gospcl, are inconsistent and incom-
patible with each other, so that whosoever would live a new life
here, in accordance with a sincere profession of the gospel, so as
thence to hope for eternal life, must withdraw himself from the
conversation of this world3 and, on the contrary, that whoever has
not withdrawn himself from the conversation of this world, does
not yet sincerely hope for eternal life, nor has yet begun to be a
new man, and to live upon this earth that life of God which is
called ‘the new life,' namely, that of an evangelica] profession:
and this is what the apostle elsewhere expressly asserts, Col. iii.
vv. 1, 2, 3, where he connects the desire, and consequently the
hope of those things which are laid up for us in that everlasting
life, with the first resurrection, subjoining—“ for ye are dead,'’ and
afterwards, ver. 5-“ mortify, therefore,’' ὤας wherefore, no man
can live a life worthy of the gospel, unless he be mortified to the
world. ⁶

This second part of the isagoge consists in a proposition, con-
tained in the two first vv. of this12th chap.; and an exposition of
the proposition, from the 3d ver. of chap. xii. to the 15th ver. of
chap. xv. The apostle proposes this exhortation of his to a life
worthy of the gospel, in these first two vv„ in two ways: first,
figuratively, by an allegory borrowed from the law, in ver. 1 ; then ·
in plain terms, without a figure, in ver. 2. The allegorical propo-
sition is this :—“ present your bodies a sacrifice to G2od;’' which
he first of all persuades to by arguments, and amplifies. The ar-
guments which he employs are three in number. Of these, the
first is taken stom the instrumental efficient cause, indicated ‘by
the words already quoted—“ I (the apostle Paul) exhort you, to

present your bodies asacrifice to God :” for evangelica] exhorta· «

tion, by the heralds of God, is the instrument of new obediente,
