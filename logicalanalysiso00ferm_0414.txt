ceived saith—as appears from almost all their descriptions: for
these descriptions shew that those whom Paul salutes in the
Church at Rome, had assisted Paul, and had been gathered by him
into the Church, in other places 3 as it is said of Mary-——‘ that she
had laboured much in his behalfi’ and so on. The ‘⁶ division'’
(διχοστασίαι), the authors of which he admonishes them to mark
and avoid, is every division which is contrary to his doctrine: the
admonition, however, is suggested by his experience of a particular
division, whereby the true Church of Christ was troubled during
all the days of the apostle’s life. This was the division which
arose about c retaining, along with saith in Christ, the ceremonies
of Moses, as equally necessary with faith to the salvation of be-

to come, and that he will har-ass the Church of Christ with schisms
¹and divisions, during the whole period of her militant state—in
admonishing the Romans, he admonishes the whole Church uni-
versally, to be on their guard against the authors of division eon-
trary to his doctrine of the gospel: from which we may learn—
that those who stand up for the sound doctrine of the gospel ean
neither be the authors, nor the foHowers of division3 but that both
ι these are such as depart from the gospel.

18. “ For those that are such,'' 850. Thus far we have had the
amplification: next comes the reason and enforeement of the ad-
monition, or the cause for which the Romans should obey the
apostle admonishing them. A double reason is assigned. The
first is contained in this verse, being taken from the ‘effect of 'those
who are the authors of divisions3 and that twofold. The first
effect is :—

. “ Those that are such ’'-that is, ‘ who are the authors of dissen-

sions and schisms ’-—“ serve their own belly,'' or, as the apostle Α

elsewhere speaks, (Phil. iii. 19)-“ their belly is their god :''
