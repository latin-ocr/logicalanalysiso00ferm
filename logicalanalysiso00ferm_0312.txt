270 LOGICAL ANALYSIS oF THE

“ it is not good that we should leave ’ the ‘word of God, and admi-
nister tables.'' The peculiar virtue of those who shew mercy is
“ cheerfulness,” inasmuch as, in their official capacity, their business
lies with the afflicted and wretched3 and because if, in ministering,
they appear morose, and disgusted with the distress of those to
whom they minister, they will aggravate the affiiction of the per-
sons to whom they ought to bring consolation: it is therefore re-
quired of them that they execute the ministry which the-y perform
towards the afflicted with cheerfulness, and in such a way as to
alleviate their affliction.

9. Thus far we have had the ordinary duties of those who have
charge in the Church of Christ, which are to be attended to with
unvarying equity, even to the second coming of the Lord. From
these we have said that the duties of the fiock are to be inferred

, and, next, that due to his office as deacon, (διακονίας,) whether he
‘distribute with simplicity,’ or ‘ shew mercy with cheerfulness.'

Next come the duties which are common at once to the flock
and to those who have charge of it3 the source and origin of ·all
which is “love'' or affection. “Let love be unfeigned.” ⁴What,
and of what sort love ought to be in all, both in the fiock and in
those who have charge of the flock, is described in 'these words,
from *the disparato. r‘ Love,’ simple* and sincere in its nature, is
uniformly seen in the face and actions, as proceeding from the
