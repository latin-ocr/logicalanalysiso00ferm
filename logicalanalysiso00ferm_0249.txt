these is a reductio acl absurdzwn,* or reasoning from that which is
impossible, thus :—

‘If the reservation through grace were itself also from works,
then grace would not be grace.

‘ But that grace should not be grace is impossible ε

‘ Thereforc, if the reservation be from grace, it follows that it is
no longer from works?

“ But if it be from works, it is no longer grace.'’ The second
argument for the hypothetica] proposition is from that which
equally follows on the contrary suppositionz——If the reservation
were made from works, then it would not be through grace3 and
if the reservation were through grace, it would no longer be from
the works of the law? “ Otherwise, work is no longer work.’'
He next proves the antecedent of the last argument, as he had
before proved the hypothetica] proposition of the syllogism by
reasoning from that which is impossible :—‘ Work would not be
work ς’ and because it is impossible that contradictories should be
true at the same time—a thing, however, which he must of neces-
sity admit to be true, who asserts, either that the merit of work is
gratuitous, or that the gratuitous reservation of the elect is from
works. The proposition and assumption of the syllogism, therefore,
having thus been proved, the conclusion or inference follows—
‘ that reservation to. life and righteousness is not from works ς’
which the apostle here deduces and infers, in order forcibly to im-
press upon the Romans the leading conclusion of the whole epistle,
with which this inference is in reality identical, viz.,—‘ THAT THIS
RIGHTEOUSNESS ΛΝΒ LIFE ΑΒΕ THROUGH THE FAITH OF THE
GOSPEL? From this I would have you observe-——that neither can
there be either righteousness or life to any man from the works of
the law, as the Jews thought, and almost all, through a perverted
zeal for the law, think still 3 nor can any works of the law concur
with the grace of God in J esus Christ as causes for procuring life
and righteousness to man, as the Papists think—because merit and
»the gratuitous giving of >life are so mutually opposite, that either

* Shcwing that the opposite supposition lands us in absurdity.
