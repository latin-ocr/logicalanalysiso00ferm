EmsTLE or PAUL To THE ROMANS. 287

not in the Lord: nor is obedience to be rendered to him by the
inferior3 and that, indeed, “because of conscience,’' that is, ‘lest by
yielding obedience to the unjust and ungodly injunction of his su-
perior, he should sin against God, and therefore against conscience.’
As, therefore, he must obey his superior, because of conscience,
as the apostle says3 so, because of conscience, he must refuse obe-
dience to his superior, whenever, in enjoining, he departs from
obedience to God, who alone is supreme, and whose will alone is
the rule of justice, so that whatever he shall have willed he may
enjoin, and whatever he shall have enjoined, ought to be performed
by every man. Although, therefore, these relative injunctions are
propounded simply, and only to inferiors, yet by analogy, and in
due correspondence, they are twofold3 just as in Eph. vi. 1-10, the
apostle expresses the fifth commandment of the Decalogue, and
thence infers these duties also.

1. ‘⁶ Let every soul be subject to the superior powers.” “ Soul”
is here put, by synecdoche, for the compound whole, viz.—‘ every
man whom God has in any way made inferior to another, especi-
ally in the state ;’ so that, the meaning is-—‘ let every man be sub-
ject to him whom the Lord may have set over him in the state τ’
under the name of ‘ subjection,’ again, as a sort of abridgment, all
duty whatever, which any inferionowes, in the Lord, to his supe-

rior, is included. Accordingly, this is the only injunction express- ,

ed in the chap.; and, from it another is, by analogy, to be inferred.
The injunction expressed is this——“ Let every soul''—‘ every infe-
rior man'—-“ be subject”-‘ perform every duty which he ought to
perform in the Lord'-—“ to the superior powers,'’ that is-—‘ to those
whom the Lord has set over him ς’ and. the injunction is general,
conceming the duty to be performed to any one who is superior in
the state, in whatever degree he may be superior, or by whatever
name he may be called, as Peter expounds this passage, (lst Ep.
ii. 13, 14.) Here, however, it is deserving of our attention, that
the apostle does not say—‘ superior powers-'ul ones,' but “powers ξ’
whereby- he would intimate that the Christian, in the duty of his
