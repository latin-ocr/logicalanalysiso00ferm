112 LOGICAL ANALYSIS OF THE

lows a reply to the two remaining objections touching the law:—
lst, ‘ That the law of God is not the law of sin, or sinful sin,’ as
was objected, chap. vii. 7 ; 2d, ‘ That the law of God is not death,'
which was the objection brought forward in chap. vii„ 13, for
death is the consequence of sin, but that sinful sin, or inherent
corruption, which is contrary to the law of God, is the cause of
every sin, and of death from sin as has been before replied.

CHAPTER VIII.

1. “ There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are
in Christ J esus.'' From the 18th verse of chapter] up to this
place the subject of righteousness has been discussed. Next
comes the discussion concerning life and salvation, as we stated in
our remarks on the same 18th verse of the first chapter. This
discussion, like the former, consists of two partsz the constructive
reasoning, which is contained in the chapter before us3 and the
destructive, which is given in the following chapters, as far as
chapter xii.

through the saith of J esus Christ according to the gospel,’ or
which is the same thing, and equivalent thereto—that ‘⁴ there is
no condemnation to those who are in Christ ,J esus ;” for life or
salvation and condemnation are so directly opposed to each other,
that either of them being affirmed, the other is denied, and the
contrary. Therefore, although the apostle here reasons affirma-
tively concerning life and salvation, yet he states his conclusion in
the form of a negation of the contrary :—‘ Therefore there is no
condemnation to those who are in Christ J esus? By ‘⁴ condem-
nation” I understand here—J the sentence of God, as J udge,
against man, conc-erning sin and death 3 ' whether that sentence
