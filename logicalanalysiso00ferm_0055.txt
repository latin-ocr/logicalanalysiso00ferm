EPISTLE or PAUL To THE quANs. 13

The antecedent is proved, first in common, then by parts.

The common argument is drawn from the effect of ungodlincss
and unrighteousness, which is—‘ the wrath of God displayed from
heaven in his judgments :⁹

ζ The wrath of God is revealed from heaven, or has been dis-
played in his judgments against all ungodlincss and unrighteous-
ness of men whosoever they be 3

‘ Therefore all men are chargeable with ungodliness and un-
righteousness.'

The antecedent of this enthymeme is contained in the first part
of the lssth verse :—“ As those who hold the truth in unrighteous-

the light of godliness and. righteousness ς’ for “the truth’' here
spoken of is that light and knowledge of one’s duty towards God
and man which is possessed by means of th e law, whether written
or unwritten 3 and to “ hold” this “ in unrighteousness,” is, pos-

transgressors of duty contrary to it.

Thus far the common proof of the antecedent, and that all men
“ hold the truth in unrighteousness,” or, which is the same thing,
are chargeable with all ungodliness and unrighteousness. He next
proves the same thing, in order, by parts : first, in regard to the
Gentiles, that they hold the truth in unrighteousness, from the nine-
teenth verse of the first, to the sixth verse of the second chapter;
then, making a transition concerning the Jews also, as far as the
twentieth verse of chapter ii.

19. “Because that which may be known concerning God is
manifest in them.’' Of the'first part of the proof there are two
branches‚ for the apostle first proves the argument of amplifica-
tion, namely that the Gentiles possessed the truth, as far as verse
twenty-oum then that they held it in unrighteousness, in the
