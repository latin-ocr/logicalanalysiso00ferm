170 LOGIGAL ANALYSIS or* THE

18. “ Therefore to whom he will he sheweth mercy, and whom
he will he hardeneth.” This is the common conclusion, deduced
from both testimonies, in this way :—

God testifies to Moses—that he does not will to confer grace
upon all Israel, along with Moses himself, Exod‚ xxxiii. 16,
compared with 193 for verse 19 contains the answer to the re-
quest of Moses in verse 16), but on whom he shall have
willed3 and (in Exod. ix. 16) he testifies that Pharaoh has been
raised up by him that he may shew his own power in his punish-
ment:

ζ Therefore to whom he will God shews mercy, and whom he
will he hai-dens?

The apostle, therefore, here teaches us that the will of God in
itself (Eph. i. 5), and that most free, is the most just cause and
source of predestination, and indeed both of the election of &he
elect unto salvation, and of the rejection of the rejected to condem..

nation.

19. “ Thou wilt say therefore unto me, Why is he still angry 5³³⁹
This is the third prolepsis, and anticipation of an objection where-
by the adversary perseveresin charging God with injustice, but
on a new ground, vi2., because he 1s angi-y with, or condemns and
punishes those who are hardened. The objection runs thus· —-

‘If Grod hardens whom he will, it is unjust that he should be
angry with those who are hardened3

‘But the former is true,’ the adversaries object, ‘ and so you
yourself conclude z

‘ Therefore the latter is true also?

This objection of the adversaries is therefore suggested by the
foregoing conclusion of the apossse, which they take for their as-
sumption. “ For who can resist his will ?'' The assumption be-
ing manifest, taken as it ¹is out of the apostle’s own mouth, the ad-
versary proves the proposition of his objection by an argument
drawn from the omnipotence of the will of God, thus :—-‘ No man
can resist the will of God.
