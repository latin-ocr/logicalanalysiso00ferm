But the Israelites, having a zeal of God, are not subJect to·

God's righteousness :
‘ Wherefore the zeal of God which the Israelites have is not that

which is according to knowledge?

The proposition of the syllogism is omitted as obvious. The ,

assumption is given at the close of verse δᾶ, illustrated by its
causes, of which two are adduced in the preceding words of the
verse : the first is—-⁴ ignorance of God's righteousness ;’ the second
—‘ desire of their own righteousness :' for it is because they are
ignorant of God’s righteousness, and desirous of their own right-
eousness, that the Israelites, having a zeal of God, are yet not sub-

ignorance of God's righteousness, and then to desire and zeal of
their own righteousness, as its causes3 not speaking of their own
righteousness because they either had or could have any right-
eousness of their own, but calling that their own, after which,
although to no purpose, they 'strove in their own strength. From

this the apostle would teach us two things ε first, that no one can

be subject to God's righteousness who is ignorant of God's right!

is necessary for faith and rendering obedience to Christ ε seeondly,
that all who subiect themselves to Christ must renounce their own
righteousness ; so that human merit, or the desire ⁴of our· own
