⁴ 276 LOGICAL ANALYSIS or THE

of which others are the subject, arises from a threefold foundation ἐ’
first, from the different sorts of men with whom we live, vv. 13,
14 3 then, from the different mental affections of those with whom‘
we live, v. 15 ; and, thirdly, from their different effects, vv. 16, 17,
18. Α5 regards the first, or the different sorts of men with whom
we live, the apostle divides all men 11110-ι saints,’ and ‘persecu-'
tors’ (διωκόντας); where he would have us observe in passing,
that all who are not, along with us, partakers of the Holy Spirit
unto sanctification, are ‘ persecutors' (διωκόντες) of the saints: as
also appears from the first announcement of the gospel, (Gen. iii.
15), whence the apostle appears to borrow this distribution3 for
as all men are there divided into ί the seed of the serpent' and ‘ the
seed of the Church3’ so it is distinctly stated that there will be
perpetual war and persecution on the part of the seed of the 501·-
pent against the seed. of the Church, until at length the head of

Rev. xii. Concerning our duty towards the saints, he gives two
injunctions: the first relates to that sacred ‘ communication'
(κοινωνίας), whereby we relieve the poverty of the saints and the
necessities of our brethren, according to the measure of the boun-
ties conferred upon us3 the second, enjoining the exercise of hos-
pitality towards others.

14. “ΒῙο55 those who persecute you3 bless (I say) and curse
not.’' Concerning persecutors,* and our duty towards them, there
is but one injunction—“ bless them ;'’ which the apostle amplifice
by repetition—“ bless (I say)‚’' and by the prohibition of the con-
trary—“ curse not.’' By such solicitude and earnest commendar-
tion of this duty, the apostle would teach us two things :—the first
is, that in the remains of the flesh and corrupt nature (τῇ φῦσα),

we are prone to curse those who persecute us3 the second, that in,- .

the zeal of Gocl and in the strength of the spirit, we should cape-3
cially strive against this corruption of the flesh, and endeavour to.
