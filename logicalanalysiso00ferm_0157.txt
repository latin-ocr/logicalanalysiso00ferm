musrns os PAUL To THE Romus. 115

‘ But I am a sinner and unrighteous ⁷-liere conscience again
supplies the assumption ;

⁴ Therefore my condemnation is just?

To these stand opposed two evangelioal syllogisms3 the first of
which is :--

‘ Those who are in Christ, apprehendet] through the faith of the
gospel, are righteous'——this the assumption of the general syllo-
gism and antecedent of the foregoing enthymeme, has been de-
monstrated by the apostle, from chap. i. 18, to chap. v. 203

‘ But Ι am in J esus Christ'—the testimony of the indwelling
Spirit and the work of regeneration, in him who is conscious of
it, adding this assumption :

‘ Therefore I am righteous, and set free from sin.

The second evangelical syllogism runs thus :—

‘ To those who are in Christ, apprehended through the saith of
the gospel, there is no condemnation ⁹—this was the conclusion of
the general syllogism and consequent of the foregoing enthymeme 3

‘ But I am in Christ J esus '--which is to be tried by the testi-
mony and work of the indwelling spirit, as has just been said :

‘ Therefore to me there is no condemnation.’

All and each of the parts of this last syllogis'm are discussed by
the apostle in his constructive reasoning concerning life and sal-
vation in the chapter before us.

First of all, we have the proposition, which is the above conclu-
· sion of the apostle—“ There is no condemnation to those who are
in J esus Christ, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit 3 ''
this conclusion, having been stated in the first verse, is establish-·
ed in the verses that follow, as far as verse 93 whence to verse 31,
the assumption is discussed 3 and the conclusion from that verse

, to the end of the chapter.

2. ‘⁴ For the law of the spirit of life (who is) in J esus Christ

· hath delivered me stom the law of sin and of death.'' As the pro-³

position itself was twofold, so the proof of it is likewise divided
into two branches3 for the apostle first proves, i'n verses 2, 3,
