condly, because, although they had embraced Christ, such was the
effect of their weakness, that Christ was not yet formed in them,
so that the apostle says (in chap. iv. ver. 19)-‘ that he travails
again with them, until Christ should be formed in them.'

This is, accordingly, the first injunction in this division, in which
the apostle prescribes their duty both to the strong and to the
weak in faith: to the former indeed, cxpresslyss‘ that they should
receive the weak in faith, of both kinds 3’ but to the latter, namely,
the weak of either sort, by consequence—J that they should give
themselves up to be received by the strong.' ‘ To receive a weak
brother,' moreover, is—‘to embrace him as a brother in Christ,
notwithstanding his weakness, and to endeavour to remove his
weakness by gently instructing him 3’ as Aquila and Priscilla,
having embraced Apollos as a brother, taught him with gentleness
the way of the Lord more perfectly, ‘ To give themselves up to γ
be received,' on the other hand, comprises the two following things :
first-‘ that they should acknowledge, with thanks, the favour of
their being so received and embraced as brethren by the strong ;’
then—‘ that they should willingly give themselves up to be in—
structed by the strong, for the removal of their weakness, and sup-
plying the defect which has been in them ε’ and if, in either of
these, the weak shall sin, they are guilty of a violation of Christian
duty, and of sinning against that very beginning which they have
made in Christ. Hence the apostle at length severely reproves
those who do not receive instruction, (Gal. iii. 1); yea, contends
against them, (Acts xv· 1) 3 yea, calls them “ false brethren,'’
‘ messengers of Satan,’ ‘ false apostles,' ‘ seducers,' (2 Cor. xi. 123-
Gal. ii. 4). From this it appears, that those thinqs indzjfferent, in
which we are to bear with our weak brethren, are not indifferent
simpliciter and absolutely, but secundum quid, and ‘as regards time3
that is, with respect to the weakness of those who believe—concern:
ing whom the expectationis, that they may be strengthened by gen-
tle instruction—and only so long as they suffer themselves tobe so'
instructed: for if they persist in rejecting the duty of the strong- in
receiving and instructing them, they cease to be weak in saith 3 and
