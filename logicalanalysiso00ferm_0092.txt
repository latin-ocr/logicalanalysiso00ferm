50 LOGIOAL ANALYSIS OF THE

We should here remark, in passing, the threefold form of expres-
sion employed by the apostle in reference to this subject 3 for he
says that we are justified “by saith? “from faith,'’ and ⁴⁴ through
faith:” of which formulae the difference is, that the first denotes
the instrument,- the second the matter ; and the third the form of
our justification or righteousness. The term “faith,” therefore,
in the first, is used in its proper sense ς but in the other two it- is
put by metonymy for ‘J esus Christ ς’ for we say that we are jus-
tified ‘⁴ throuqlz Christ,'⁷ intimating the form, and that we are jus-
tified ‘⁴ in Christ,'’ denoting the matter3 but I do not remember
that the apostle any where says that we are justified by Christ
absolutely, and as the instrument. *

31. “Do we therefore make void the law through faith ‘?”

This is a prolepsis, in which he anticipates an objection which
might be brought forward by the Jews, charging the conclusion
with detriment, as they formerly (lid the assumption. The ob-
Jection is this :—

⁴ If man is justified by faith, the law is rendered useless and abo-
lished :

But the latter supposition is absurd.'

⁴⁴ Far from it.'’ The apostle replies to the proposition first, by
repelling it with abhorrence as an impious calumny—⁴ far be it fi·om
us to abolish the law :’ secondly, by reasoning from the greater to
the less—⁴ not only do we not render useless and abolish the law,
but we shew its use and establish it? For its use was to lead us

Δ to Christ, as the apostle speaks in Gal. iii. 24-ι The law was our
child-leader, pointing to Christ? And it is established in Christ:
first, by its fulfilment in his blood3 for inasmuch as Christ therein
fulfilled the law, he shewed that the law and all its ceremonies were*

³¹⁶ That is, that the word ⁴ Christ’ is never found in such a connection in the dative
case, which is the ordinary mode of expressing instrumentality in the Greek language,
and which is the manner in which the word‘ faith' is used m the first formula. This
statement may appear to be overthrown by Acts xiii. 39: Rom. v. 93 and Gal ii 173
but these are only apparent excepffions, the literal rendering in these passages. re-
