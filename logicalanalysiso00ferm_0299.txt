EPISTLE on PAUL To THE ROMANs. 257

prove it when understood, but cannot embrace it, as the classical
writer testifies concerning Medea—

“ The best I see and can approve,
The worst 1 still pursue and love ;“’*

and, therefore, the apostle here subjoins this proving of the will of
God as the proper end of the renewal of our mind, and of our se-
paration from “the present evil world.''

“That good and acceptable.’' He proceeds to illustrate “the
will of God,” as in the preceding verse he had illustrated the
Christian sacrifice by a threefold epithet. First, [by saying] that it
is ‘⁶ good,'’ or ‘ wholly relates to good things,' so that whatever God
wills to be done by the regenerate, is itself good. Secondly, [by say-
ing] that it is ⁴‘ acceptablo,'’ that is——‘ that it, in like manner, re-
lates to things acceptable to God,' so that whatever is done by the
regenerate, according to the will of God,is acceptable to God in J esus

Christ, andis regarded as his service: hence, when the apostle exhorts
’ the regenerate to duty, he ordinarily employs this argument—‘ that
it is acceptable to God, (Phil. iv. 183 Col, iii. 203 1 Tim. ii. 8.)
Moreover, by these two things, vi2.—-‘ that it is good and acceptable
to God,’ the apostle distinguishes the will of God from all human pre-
cepts in the matter of religion, which those who obey, under the idea
of serving God, neither do well, nor is what they do acceptable to
· God, as ourLord himself testifies, in Matt. xv. 9, when he says—
‘ that all such service is vain.' “ Perfect.” This is the third epi-
thet· of the divine will, whereby it is distinguished from all science,
art, or other tradition whatsoever of men concerning duty} for all
these⁸ are imperfect3 whereas, on the contrary, the divine will,
made known by the law, is in every way complete, and shews to
man 111 the most perfect manner, what he should either do, or not
<103 what is duty, and what a violation of duty.¹

3. Thus far we have had the proposition3 now comes the expli—
cation of it, which wholly consists in various injunctions concern-
ing duty, according to the sound doctrine of the gospe13 'for ‘ to
