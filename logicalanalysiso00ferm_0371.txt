EPlsTLE oF PAUL To THE ROMANS. 329

⁴ Therefore, to eat that whereby a brother stumbles, incidentally,
at least, and with respect to his stumbling, is evil!

The antecedent is given in this verse, in which the three contra-
dictories—⁴⁴ not to eat,’' ⁴⁴ not to drink,’' ⁴⁴ not to d0,” are each il-
lustrated by their subjects3 the subject of ‘not eating‚’ being——
⁴⁴ flesh 3⁹⁹ of ⁴ Ποῖ drinking,’--⁴⁴wine,” and of ‘not doing,’-—⁴⁴ any-
thing.'’ ⁴⁴ VVhereby thy brother stumbleth,'’ 8⁶0. In this, the re-
maining part of the antecedent, the apostle expresses the cause of
offence put in the way of weak brethren, by a striking gradation
from the less : ⁴ to stumblc’ being the least; ⁴ to be offended,’ greater3
and ⁴ to be made weak,' among the greatest. For “to stumble”
‘'is—⁴ to fall by imitating the example of another,' or ⁴ to do any-
thing without faith, and the consciousness of doing well, which,
nevertheless, would be well done, if faith, and therefore conscience,
were strong.⁹ ⁴⁴ To be offended,’' again, is—⁴ to be inwardly
grieved on account of that fall, which would yet be no fall, if saith
were strong, and conscience frear Lastly, ⁴⁴ to be made weak'’ is—
'⁴ for faith itself, previously weak, and conscience, incidentally defiled,
*to lose strength by degrees3 so that, unless help arrive from God,
they at length become altogether extinct.' Or you may choose
rather to refer these three things to different objects, and to con-
sider the weak as stumbling at his own deed, vi2., what he does in
imitation of the example of the stronger3 as offended by the deed
of the stronger3 and as contracting weakness of faith from both.

22. ⁴⁴ Thou hast saith? This is the conclusion of the second in-
junction, embeUished with a rhetorical concession and epanorthosis :
—⁴I willingly grant you, that you have faith3 nevertheless, have
vit to yourself, and before God, not openly, to the stumbling of your
brethren? The term ⁴⁴ saith,’' is here used for—⁴ the full persuae
‘sion (πληξθφθξῖα) of Christian liberty 3’ so that the meaning of the
²apostle 'is the following :—⁴ of this my injunction, whereby I en-
join you to exercise judgment for this end, that you may not put a
cause of offence in the way of a weak brother by your deed, the
sum and conclusion is this, that I grant‘and acknowledge to you,
