EmsrLE or PAUL To THE ROMANs. 187

righteousness, and Christ, or God’s righteousness in him, are
things inconsistent and such as cannot subsist together.

4. “ For Christ is the end of the law.’' He now proves the last
assumption, viz—that the Israelites do not subject themselves to
God's righteousness ; the argument being drawn from the primary
and principal subject of God’s righteousness, which is J esus
Christ :

‘ Whoever is subject to God's righteousness is also subject to
Christ J esus 3 ’

‘ But the Israelites have not subjected themselves to Christ ε

‘ Therefore neither are they subject to God's righteousness?

The assumption is obvious even to the opponents themselves:

explains the foregoing description of Christ, wherein he is said· to‘
be> “the end ef the law '' by its end ; and the end again- by its
subject, Christ is—“ the end of* the law· for righteousness,” i. e„
