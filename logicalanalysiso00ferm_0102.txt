60 LOGICAL ANALYSIS oF THE

the apostle has already said.——“ Who is the father of us all.''
This is a prolepsis in which he anticipatos an objection of the
Jews glorying in the law, and in Abraham as their father. ‘ God
gave the law,' the Jews might object, ⁴ to the whole seed of Ab-
raham with whom he made the covenant ; how is it then that you
say, in your distribution of the seed, thatbesides the seed which
is of the law, there is another seed of Abraham to whom the. pro-
mise is made ?’ To this objection the apostle here replieS, by as-
serting—‘ that Abraham is the father of us all, even of those who
believe without the 1aw.’

and explanation of his preceding reply, from the adjunct of the
manner,—‘ Abraham is the father of many nations, not, however,
carnally, and in the flesh, but before God whom he believed, and
in the spirit? The apostle, therefore, wishes to teach the Jews
by this reply of his, that Abraham has another posterity, and
another racc, than that which they knew of: for they knew of no
other offspring of Abraham than that which was according to the
flesh3 but the apostle here says that there is another before God,
-and in spirit, through the faith of Abraham, which, like Isaac, was
born to Abraham by the power of the promise of God, as the apostle.
speaks more plainly in Gal. iv. 23, &Q ‘To be a father before
-God,’ therefore, here means to be a father by the power of the pro-
.mise of God‚ and with respect to God promising: for God promised
to Abraham that many nations would be his seed, and the promise
was made concerning many nations who should be a seed to
