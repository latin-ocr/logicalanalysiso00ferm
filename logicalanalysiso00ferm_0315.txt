EP1s'rLE OF PAUL To THE ROMANS. 273

(since even the law, apart from the gospel, urges love,) that the
love of the gospel is the love of brethren indeed, but of brethren
regenerated in J esus Christ3 whereas that of the law is the love of
brethren in the flesh (κατὰ σάρκα) only. “ In honour going be-
fore each other.’' This is the second injunction having respect to
the second table of the law 3 which he extends, in an evangelical
acceptation, (κατ’ ἐυαγγέλιον) as a commentary upon the first pre-
cept of the second table ε for there, in a legal sense, every one who
is inferior in state, condition, age, or in any other respect accord-
ing to the flesh, is commanded to shew honour to his superior;
but the apostle, propounding the precept in an evangelical sense,
commands that, in the judgment of love, every one who is in Christ
should esteem another who is equally in Christ, as “ before,'’ or
‘ superior to'⁴ himself, and should honour him on account of the
grace that is in him. For so the apostle explains his own meaning in
many places z-—“ Consider those who walk so, as ye have us for an
example’' (Phil. iii. 17 >3 ‘⁶ We pray you, brethren, to acknow-
ledge those who labour among you, and preside over you in the
Lord, and admonish you, so as to esteem them exceedingly dear ⁵
for their work’s sake'' (l Thess. v. 12, 13); ‘⁶ Obey and be sub-
ject to those who rule over you⁹³ (Heb. xiii. 17); in all which
places, writing to churches, and even to the more powerful (δυνά-
στας) in those Churches, he yet charges them to submit themselves
to the preachers of the gospel, how humble, and of how despicable
a condition soever according to the fiesh,* on account of the grace
of preaehing, or the grace given to them to preach the gospel.
But this is proved in a more general manner by what the apostle
says in commending Onesimus to his master, as well as by the
common injunction (Eph. vi. 9)—-“ Ye masters do that which is
just unto your servants, leaving off threatening, (ἀνιέντες τὴν ἀπει-
Mu), knowing that your own master also is in heaven, and that
there is no respect of persons with him :” in which words the
⁴apostle most distinctly charges even the powerful masters in the
