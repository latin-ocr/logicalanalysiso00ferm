EPISTLE OF PAUL To THE ROMANS. 303

‘ Therefore, so is also the latter!

“ Let us therefore cast off the works of darkness.'' This is the
common conclusion concerning the duty to be performed by the
Christian, both in the Church, and in the State, deduced from the
foregoing argument from the season, as is indicated by the par-
ticle (οὖν) “ therefore,'' in this way 2——

‘ If it is now time for us to awake from sleep‚ we ought to cast
off the works of darkness, and to live dutifully, as children of light,

‘ But the former is true:

‘ Therefore, so is also the latter?

The assumption has been previously given3 the conclusion is
contained in the words last quoted. “ And let us put on the habit

of God in Christ?

, 13. “Let us walk orderly, as in the day.'' This is the second
part of the casting off of the works of darkness, having respect to
“ walk,’' or ‘outward action :'-—‘ the walk or caniagess that is, ‘ every
outward action of the body, of us who are Christiana, should be or-
dered by, and conformed to the word of God, and such as befits us
in the light and in the day? “ Not in revellings.'' He again illus-
