to the sound doctrine of the gospel, devolves on all who profess the'
gospel, and this twofold duty again arises out of the double relation
which they sustain: for sincere professors of the gospel are, in the
first place, members of the Church of God, and in this relation
they are bound to those mutual duties which befit the members of
a body of that kind 3 then they are members of the body politic, or
of a Christian state, and in that relation also there are duties de-
volving upon them. Concerning the duties which we owe as mem-
bers of the Church, the apostle enjoins in the remainder of this
chap. (xii.) ; and concerning those to which we are bound as mem-
bers of a Christian state, in the following chap. (xiii.) The former
again, or those which devolve on professors of the gospel as mem-
bers of the Church, are also twofold3 for first, there are the duties
of the presidents,* or those who watch over others in the Church3
under which are also included the duties of those over whom they
watch, answering, by analogy and proportion, to those of theirsu-
periers: and concerning these, he enjoins from this place as far asv
verse 9. As there are also, now under the gospel, two classes of
men who watch over others in the Church of Christ, some “ la-
bouring in word,'' and others having charge in other ways (1 Tim-1

v. 17 ); so there are two parts of this enjoining: the one respects
. those who teach3 the other, those who have charge in other ways
in Christ's church. Both of these are exemplified by the apostle
in the words already quoted, and that jointly, by their common
object3 for the apostle here denominates every one, under the
gospel, who watches over others in the Church of Christ in any
way—‘⁴ one who is among them'' (Τὸν ὄντα ἓν &vv-⁰79) afte'r the
example of Solomon, who, in 1 Kings iii. 7, describes the duty‘of
a king, by his “Jgoing out and coming in” among his subjecte:
‘he who is (ὁ ὧν) in the Church,' therefore, in the passage before
us, is—-‘ he that goes out a'nd comes in, in the sight of God and οξ
hi's Church, is one who has charge? “ Let him not be wisc more
than he' ought to be wise3 but let him be wisc unto sobrietyfi
