EPISTLE or PAUL To THE ROMANS. 185

that Christ was to be both the son and Lord of David, were yet
ignorant how he could be both his son and his Lord (Matt. xxii :)
so, in this place, the apostle imputes the zeal of the Israelites in
establishing their own righteousness, which is from the works of
the laW, to ignorance of the righteousness of God. The apostle,
therefore, here ascribes to the Israelites a zeal of God, but built
upon the ignorance of what is commonly called a (ζ crooked’' dis-
position, that is, not upon God's word, of which, as has been said,
they were ignorant, but upon the traditions of the fathers replete
with errors, which, however, they both knew and followed with
zeal. This was Paul's own condition before he was called by
J esus Christ (Gal. i. 143 Phil. iii. 63) and this, Paul testifies in
the passage before us, was the condition of the rest of the Israel-
ites who still spoke against Christ. Such a condition of men, the
apostle here teaches us by his example, is rather an object of
pity than of hatred3 and therefore he testifies, that he was
moved by the Spirit of God, from a holy compassion for this
condition, to utter prayers to God in behalf of those who were
affected with such a zeal of G0d‚ that, being ignorant of God’s
truth, they might be delivered from the judgment of their
apostacy.

3. “ For being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and desiring to
establish their own righteousness, they have not been subject to
God's righteousness.'' He proceeds t‘o prove the latter part of the
contrast, or ‘ that the zeal of God which the Israelites had was
not according to knowledge? The arguments by which he proves
it are three : the first in this verse ; the second in verse 5 ; and
the third in verse 13. The first argument is drawn from the sub-
ject or object ·· of that zeal which is according to knowledge ς it is
-⁴—‘ a zeal of God’s righteousness ς’ of which ‘ the zeal of the
Israelites,’ who have a zeal of God, is the disparate. The apostle,
therefore, thus reasons :—

‘ That zeal of God which is according-to knowledge is subject
to God’s righteousness;
