220 LOGICAL ANALYSIS or THE

of these first fruits, in order that the rest of the mass might be
sanctified for the use of God’s people, (see Lev. xxiii„ verses 9-
22. ‘ The first fathers of the Israelites,’ Abraham, Isaac and Jacob,
are, therefore, here compared to the first fruits 3 because, as in the
offering of these first fruits unto God, the whole “mass was sanc-
tified, so ⁴ Israel' was holy, and, therefore, beloved in these fathers,
as the apostle afterwards explains in verse 28-(ζ as regards the
gospel, they are enemies for your sakes 3 but, as regards election‚
they are beloved for the fathers' sakes.” In the latter part of the
proof, again, the metaphor is taken from trees, in which, of what-
ever sort the root may be, such will also be the natural branches ε
here, too, therefore, ‘the first fathers’ are compared to the root,
and ‘their posterity down to the latest,' to the branches. This
metaphor is transferred by the apostle to this place, out of Isaiah
xi. 1, where ‘J esse the Bethlehemite, the father of David,’ is com-

“branch” or “scion :⁷⁹ whence, in Zech. iii. 8, he is styled—a
“ sprout ;'’ and, further, to shew that. he is the last scion, (Isaiah
iv. 2‚)—“ the sprout of J ehovah,” because he was raised up by
God the Father, in the Son, through the Spirit, from the decayed·
kingdom of David, like a new sprout germinating afresh from a

root.

17. “ But if,'’ 850. This is a prolepsis, wherein the apostle re-·
plies to a twofold objection of the Gentiles against- the Jews, and
their recal (above concluded in verse 15‚) to the God of their sal-
vation through the gospel. As the Gentiles were a reproach to
the Jews so long as the ministry of the law continued among the
latter, as this same apostle testifies in Eph. ii. 113 and Peterin
Acts x. 18 3 so the apostle foreseeing that the Jews, as rejecting
Christ, would be a reproach to the Gentiles who had professed-
Christ, and knowing that this would not be to the advantage, but
to the serious injury of the Jews, since they would thence take
occasion to oppose the gospel the more, endeavours to anticipate
the evil by refuting the objections which he foresaw that the Gen-
