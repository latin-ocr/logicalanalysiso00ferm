glorying in their knowledge. This he shews to be vain, by
reasoning from the less to the greater :—‘ thou dost not even
teach thyself: ‘ Therefore thy parade of thy knowledge is worth-
less?

“ Thou that preachest that a man should not steal‚ thou steal-
est.'’ He proves the antecedent from the conduct of the Jews,
and by an induction of the violated law :—

‘ Thou that preachest and teachest that another should not steal,
