EmSTLE oF PAUL To THE RoMANs. 29

17. “Behold thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law.''
Thus far the first part of the proof in which he has established,
both concerning the Gentiles in general, and concerning their wise
men in particular, that they hold the truth of God in unrighteous-
ness, and has vindicated, in passing, against the complaints both
= of J ew and Gentiles, the justice of the judgment of God to which
he has made the Gentiles liable. Next comes the second part of
the proof, viz.: that even the Jews themselves, who possess the
truth in the written law, held that truth in unrighteousness ; the

knowledge which they had obtained from the law.⁷ This the
apostle variously amplifies in accordance with their own ideas:
first, by its object—because it is the knowledge of the will of God,
‘and of those things that are at variance with that will ; then by
its effects—by means of it, truly, the Jews are the guides of
the blind, cive light to them that sit in darkness, and. are the

teaehers of the foolish and of babes?

21. “ Thou, therefore, who teachest another, teachest thou not
thyself ‘P' The apostle here replies to this threefold glorying of
the J ews; but by hysterosis, he begins with the last, viz„ their
