354, LOGICAL ANALYSIS OF THE

this 20th verse, being amplified by the end, which is—‘ that Paul
might not build on another man’s foundation.’

21. “ But according as it is written.” This is the protasis of
the comparison, established by the testimony of scripture, concern-

ing—‘ Christ never having been announced to the Gentiles, before
they saw and understood through my preaching.’

22. “ For which cause, also, I have been often hindered from
coming to you.'' This is a proleptical transition from the first part
of the particulars respecting himself—or his account of the fruit of
his labours in the gospel, whence he has said that his confidence
in writing more boldly to them, arose——to the second part, in which
he endeavours to gain the good will of the Romans, to whom he
has written with holy confidence. The objection which he antici-
pates is this :—‘ seeing that Illyricum is a maritime state of Greece,
on the south-eastern coast of the Adriatic Sea, separated only by a
small intervening space from Italy 3 why have you not come to us
who are in Rome, the chief state of all Europe, that you might ex-
tend your labours in the gospel there, especially considering the
importance of the place ?’ The apostle replies—‘ that he had pur-
posed to come to them, and that often, but that hitherto he had
been hindered from coming? There is a similar prolepsis, as we
have seen, in the exordium of the epistle, chapter i. verse 13, where
he seeks to gain the good will of the R01nans3 as he also does in

the verses that‘ follow, to which he makes a transition by this pro-
lepsis.

23. In the subsequent verseS, on to the close of the chapter, he
seeks to gain the good will of the Romans. The arguments which
he employs for this purpose are three. The first is >taken from his
'promise to come to them, as far as verse 30. This promise, which
- is proposed in the 24th verse, he both confirms and amplifies. Α The

arguments by which he confir-ms it, in this 23d verse, are twos The “

first is taken from what equally follows in the case vof disparatos,
