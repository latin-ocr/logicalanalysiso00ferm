the Gentiles, had brought upon themselves by their transgressions
against J ehovah. And that this is the meaning is manifest from the
connection of the whole song. For in the previous part of the
song, he has rehearsed the vast benefits of J ehovah to Israe13 and
from the beginnings observed under ‘his own rule, he foretells, by
the Holy Spirit, the astonishing ingratitude of the Israelites,
whereby they would afterwards provoke Jehovah, the God who
had bestowed these blessings upon them: hence, in the third place,
he warns them that, as hitherto, in the time of Moses, the other
nations had been rejected, so it would come to pass that God would
at length reject Israel also, for wickedness in them, similar to the
wickedness of the Gentiles: in the fourth place, by way of epan-
orthosis, he foretells, that the remnant of Israel will be gathered
again to Jehovah‚ in the Messiah, of whom he had spoken as, a pro-
phet, like to himself, to be raised up from the midst of the Israel-
ites: and in order that he may shew that the Gentiles, who had
previously been rejected, would be partakers with Israel in this
benefit of gathering again, in these words he exhorts the Gentiles
also to rejoice in J ehovah, with Israel gathered again. Hence Paul
infers from the exhortation of Moses—‘ the gathering again of the
Gentiles in common with the Israelites, that J ehovah-may be ex-
tolled by both for his mercy in J esus Christ.' Π One thing in this
scripture must be noticed, which has perplexed many interpreters.
In Moses there is an asyndeton, or omission of the copula 3 so that
the literal translation of the words is—“ Rejoice, ye Gentiles, his
people,’' for—‘ and his people 3’ the copula being understood: this
copula, Paul, here, as everywhere, assigning the precedence to
Israel in that effect of exultation, renders, consistently with the
idiom of the original, by the preposition ‘ with 3'--“ rejoice, ye
Gentiles, with his people (preceding you in that effect of exulta-
tion.)’‘ For, in the Hebrew language, both these things are ad-
missible—both that the conjunction Vau may be frequently omit-
ted; and thatthe same, whether expressed 01· understood, may be
rendered by the preposition ‘ with :’ and both are here observed
and followed by Paul in this scripture, 'under the teachingofsthq
