EPISTLE OF PAUL To Tm: ROMANs. 217

them to jealousy by that which is not a people3 I will provoke
them by a foolish nation.'’

12. “But if the fall of them,'' 820. This is the fourth end for
which the Jews stumbled3 for the third, namely—‘ that some of
them might be saved,' is omitted here, to be more conveniently
expressed afterwards in verse 14: the Jews, therefore, stumbled
against J esus Christ, the Lord of their salvation: fourthly, that
their fulness might be the fulness and completion of the Church.
This end is proved from the first, by reasoning from the less to the
greater, in this way :—

‘ If the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the dimi-

fulness be the riches of the world, and of the whole Church of
God 3 ‘ But the former is true’—as we have seen in the first
end:

verse3 the assumption is proved in the next two verses3 and the
conclusion follows in verse 15. But to return to verse 12, by “the
fall‚” and “ the diminishing,’⁵ of the Jews the apostle means—the
rejection of the gospel, and of Christ offered therein, by the ma-
jority of that nation ς’ and by “the riches of the world,'' and “ of
the Gentiles,’' he means—‘ their drawing near to God by embrac-
ing the gospel, and Christ therein :' whence I would have you ob-
serve—that the diminishing and riches, either of a people, or of
individuals from among a people, are to be estimated by the pos-
session or want of J esus Christ, offered in the gospel 3 so that, he
who possesses Christ is rich, and, on the contrary, he who is with-
out Christ as he is offered 111 the gospel, is diminished.

13. “Fon” &c. He goes on to prove the preceding assump-
tion, and that the Israelites have stumbled against? J esus Christ,
offered to them in the gospel, for the ends aforesaid3 the argu-
ment being taken from the effect of Paul directed towards these
same ends :—
