first—born, to the rest of her seed, and prays :-—⁴ that as God has
put Satan under Christ, so he may put him under those who are
in Christ3 so that Satan with his emissaries, may be made the
footstool of the saints of God.' This is the first request3 for the
understanding of which, the following things must be observed in
the words of the apostle. First, that by ‘⁴ Satan⁹⁹ he especially in-
tends ‘the authors of divisione? as the chief ministers of Satan,
and sent by him into the Chur0h3 and this he does after the ex-
ample of his Lord: for since he addressed Peter, giving perverse
counsel, by the name of ζ Satan’ (Matt. xvi. 23) 3 much more might
the apostle style false brethren, perversely perverting the Church,
by that name. And this he does most wisely3 and on two accounts ι
for in the first place, by the mention of Satan, he stirs up the saints
to whom he writes, to beware of these authors of divisions and false
brethren who urged that Moses and his ceremonies must be com-
bined with faith in order to salvation, not less than they would be-
ware of the devil himself ; and in the second place, he wisely
avoids being accused by these same false brethren, who, although
in this request he was praying directly against them, would be un-
able to lay it to his charge. In the second place, we must observa
that, in this prayer, he denominates the God of the Church—“the
God of (her) peace ;’' and that too most wisely: sor he thus shews .
the Roman Church that they could not give place to the authors
'of divisione, as the Corinthian Church had done, without lesing
the peace which they had enjoyed in God, as had happened in the
case of the Corinthian church3 which, on the reception of the·
false brethren, had been filled with divisione, and especially in that
department of the ministry which was the chief token of 'their
peace in the Lord, namely, in the administration of the Lordsss ’
Supper. In the third place, we must observe the adjunct of> the

⁹ time3 the apostle prays—‘ that God may tread Satan under· their ⁵

feet,² and that—‘⁴ shortly :” by which adjunct of the time, he both*
shews his own zeal for the deliveranee of the Church of Christ fitam
, so dangerous a pest as these false brethren and authors of divisione
and besides, consoles them with the expectation of deliverane'e
