in the steps os the saith os Abraham, to wit, that which he had
when in uncircumcision.'

13. ‘⁴ For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world,
came not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through
the righteousness of faith.’' W'e have here the reasons of the epa-

( If all who were of the circumcision were also the seed of Abra-
ham, and Abraham their father, then the promise to Abraham and

‘ But the latter is salse:

‘ Theresore so is the former.’

The assumption is contained in this verse, illustrated by a con-

‘If the inheritance were from the law, the promise would be
vain, and saith on the promise would be vain, because we would
not obtain the promise3

‘ But the latter is salse:

ᾗ Therefore the promise is not through the law.'

15. “ For the law worketh wrath,”-—the proof of the proposition
from the effect of the law z—-‘ Th'e effect of the law is to work for
us the wrath os God3 Ἴ
, ‘ Since therefore the law worketh wrath, if the promise had to be
hoped for through the law our hope and saith in the promise would
be vain :’ sor the wrath os God and the attainment of the promise
are inconsistent and incompatible the one with the other. “ For
jvhere no law is there is no transgression.’' He proves the ante· ’
