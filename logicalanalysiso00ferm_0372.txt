330 LoeicAL ANALYSIS OF THE

that you have the persuasion of Christian liberty3 yet, let it be
enough for you to have that persuasion before God, that is, to be
thereby approved before God in the use of your liberty, and take
care not to make a boast and a display of that persuasion‚ to the
stumbling of those who have it not! “ Happy,'' 8⁶0. The apostle
establishes the conclusion which he has deduced, especially the
latter part of it, or the epanorthosis, whereby he has admonished

the strong to have his persuasion of Christian liberty to himself -

before God, and not to make a display of it to the stumbling of the
weak—this conclusion, I say, he establishes by two arguments.
Of these, the first is taken from a common and universally ad-
mitted maxim, which is this—“ Happy is he that condemneth >not
himself, in that where-of he approveth ;’' which the apostle thus ac·-
commodates to the stronger in faith 2—-

‘ If you make a display of your Christian liberty to the stum-
bling of the weaker, you condemn yourselves in that of which you
rightly approvet

‘ Therefore, do not make a display of it, so as ῖο cause your
weaker brethren to stumble, but have it to yourselves before God:

The proof of the antecedent is from the foregoing discussion, in
which the apostle has granted that all things are pure, and all
things lawful (whence it follows that he has rightly approved of
Christian liberty) 3 yet that, incidentally, there is sin in eating, if
one should eat with an occasion of stumbling to the weak3 from
which it follows, that if any sinned against weak brethren by the
*use of their liberty, they would condemn themselves by that very
liberty of which they rightly approved.

’ 23. “ But he that doubteth,'' ὣς). The second argument is from
the injury of a weak brother :—
‘ If, while you make a display, a weak brother shall eat in imi-
tation of your example, that weak brother is condemned for eating z
‘ Therefore do not make a display of your persuasion before the
weak, so as to lead them to imitate your example without that
persuamon?
