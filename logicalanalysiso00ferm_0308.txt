266 LoGICAL ANALYSIS oF THE

one assuming what he does not possess, or being “more wise than
116 ought to be wisc ;'’ whereas he here prohibits the abuse of a
gift received. The second part of the enjoining, therefore, is this
-ζ whoever in any way has charge in the Church of God, should
rightly and. faithfully use the gift which he has received for the
benefit of the Church, and not abuse it.' This, which is the gene-
ral proposition of the second part of the injunction, the apostle
omits 3 illustrating it, however, both by its cause, and. by a special
induction of particulars. “ But having different gifts according to
the grace which has been given unto us.'’ This is the cause of the
second part of the injunction ς from which the apostle thus
reasons :—

‘We who are in the Church of God, and have charge of Christ's
flock, have received different gifts, and these proceeding from the
spirit, through grace ς’ or, which is the same thing—‘ we have re-
ceived gifts‚ every one his own, and that freely from God, through ’
the Spirit :

⁴ Let no one therefore abuse his gift, but let every one use it for
the benefit of the Church ς’ ’

’ “ Whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the propor-
-tion of faith,'’

7. “ Or ministry, let us be occupied in ministering.'’ We have
here the second illustrat-ion of the second part, from an induction
in which he reduces all the gifts of those who have charge in the
chureh of God to two classes z The one he 'denominates “ p'ross
phecy,” (προφητέων 3) the other, “ ministry” (διακονίαν.) “ Pro-
phecy” I call ‘ the gift of teaching,' and “ ministry'’ embraces the
other gifts, all the gifts, namely, of ‚those who, though not ‘neach—
ers, have charge in the Church. We find both these words thus
used in other places. So π’ξῡφητὲυω 01· πεοφητὲιω is used in
(1 Cor. xiv. 3,) where a ‘ prophet' is said to be one that “ speak-
eth unto men,'’ that is, either “ to the edification” of the Church

of God as ateacher, or “ to exhortation and comfort” as a pastun-53 v , 25¹-
“ prophecy,” therefore, is here put⁴ for ‘any gift of 'teaching 3⁹v al· 22³¹
