it to the charge of thc unbelief of Moses, that he had not ‘sancti-
fied’ or glorified him before the people of Israel.

21. ‘⁴ And being fully persuaded.'' The third illustration is
drawn from the formal cause of his strong faith, which is ‘his
full persuasion,’ (πληξοφοξία), ⁴ Abraham was fully persuaded,⁷
(πτηξοφοξηθεὶς), therefore he was strong in faith. “ That what he
had promised he was able also to perform.’' He explains the full
persuasion * of Abraham by its efficient cause, viz„ ‘ the omnipo-
tencc of God to perform whatever he promises ς’ and this was the

to Abraham whatever he had promised.

22. “ Wherefore also it was imputed to him for righteousness.”
The apostle here makes a transition to the third section of the

lary from the strong faith of Abraham, which has just been ex—
plained———‘ because Abraham believed God, and that firmly, there-
fore faith* was imputed to Abraham for righteousness,’ 23, 24.
‘⁶ Moreover, it was written not for his sake only, that it was. im-

“ But for the sake of us also, to whom it shall be imputed.”
Here commences the third section of the chapter, and the propo-

manner of Abraham's justification has been recorded, that it was
by faith, not for his sake only, but for the sake of us also ς’ that is,
⁴ it is not merely historical, but also for our imitation and learning,
to teach us that we also are to be justified in the same way in
which Abraham was justified,' which is the proposition of the lead-
ing syllogism. The proof is from the end3 “ for the sake of us,”
-—“ namely, to those who believe,”-a restriction of the general
