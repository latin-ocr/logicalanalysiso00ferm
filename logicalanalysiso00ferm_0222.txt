180 LOGICAL ANALsts or THE

from the disparate of Israel,—“ (Israel was) not (following after
righteousness) from faith ;’' this is amplified by a contrast,——“ but
fror'n the works of the law ;'' and the apostle adds,—“ as if (ὦς) from
the works of the law,’' because, to those who had performed them
with a view to justification, they were not really the works of the
law, but only the fruits of their own hypocrisy, as our Lord testi-
fies in Mat. xxiii„ when he accuses the Scribes and Pharisees, who
gloried in such works, of hypocrisy. For no works are works of
law, unless they are altogether conformable to the law3 and such,
according to the testimony of the prophet in Ps. cxliii„ can be
found in no flesh, Christ excepted. As the Jews, however, had
sought after righteousness by these fruits of their own hypocrisy,
as if by the works of the law, and not from faith, they did not
reach the law of righteousness, or that righteousness which is ap·-
proved by the law. The apostle, therefore, would here teach us
three things : lst, That there are no works of preparation, as the
Papists speak3 for the Gentiles apprehended righteousness while
they were not seeking after it; 2d, That the merit of our own
works avails nothing for righteousness 3 for while Israel were seek-
ing after righteousness from works, they did not attain to it 3 3d,
That those who have apprehended Christ by faith, have in Christ
that righteousness which the law demands; for Israel did not
reach the law of righteousness, because they were not following
after righteousness from faith, as the Gentiles who believed, nor
after that righteousness which is approved by the law, as the
apostle has above said. “For they stumbled at the stone of
stumbling.’' We have here the reason of the unbelief of the
Israelites from their effect,-·-‘ they stumbled against Christ? The
apostle, therefore, reasons thus z—‘Whosoever stumbles against
Christ cannot be seeking after righteousness from saith, ⁹—for ‘ to
believe on Christ,’ and ί to stumble against him‚’ are opposites· „
‘But the Israelites have stumbled.
‘ Therefore,’ &a

33. “ As it is written, Behold I lay in Zion a stone of stumbling
