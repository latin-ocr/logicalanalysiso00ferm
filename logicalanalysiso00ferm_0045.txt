was ‘ made flesh of the seed of David ;' sccondly, from his divine
nature—‘ he is the Son of God ς’ this is demonstrated from its
effect—-‘ his powerful resurrection from the dead} which is also
explained by its cause—‘ his own sanctifying spirit?

4. “ (Namely), J esus Christ our Lord.'' A third illustration of
the Son of God from his names and titlcs. Of these, the first is
taken from his effect * in saving us—he is “ J Es US, ’' (Matt. i. 21);
the second from the adjunct of his ancinting—he is “ CHRIST ;”
and the third, from the dominion procured by him as the author of
our redemption—-he is our “ Lord.’'

5. “ Through whom we have received grace and apostleship.”
In these words we have a fourth illustration of the Son, from his
effects in the case of Paul, or the benefits conferred on him 3 he
gave him the grace of preaching the gospel⁷ and the apostleship,
by which he was authorised to exercise that grace, and to preach
the gospel. “For obedience to the faith among all nations for his
name.” He explains the grace and apostleship conferred on Paul
by its twofold end. Of these the first is——“ obedience to the faith‚”
which is illustrated. by its subject—‘⁴ among the nations.'’ The
second and> more remote end is—the ‘ glorifying of the name of
Christ ' through that obedience 3 or the name of Christ is put for
Christ, the object of the grace of the faith preached among the
nations ε for there is no other name, (Acts iv. 12.)

6. “Among whom are ye also.'’ He applies the end of his
apostleship to the Romans in this way ι The apostleship has been
s given to me for obedience to the faith among the nations ι ‘ But
you are among the nations‚ therefore also for obedience to the
faith among you? “The called by Christ J esus,’' a setting forth
and subjoined explanation of those Romans for whose obedience
.to the faith the apostle has said that the grace of the apostleship
had been given to him. They are “the called‚'' not merely by
