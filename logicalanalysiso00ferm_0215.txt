EPISTLE OF PAUL TO THE ROMANs. 173

‘ God, in order to make known his power—as has been previously
said in reference to Pharaoh—has endured, with much long suffer-
ing, the vessels of wrath, that is, of dishonour, although framed for
destruction, and hardened according to the will of God 3 and has
long deferred executing judgment upon them, even while acting
wickedly :

‘ Therefore, although he hardens whom he will, yet not only is
he not unjust in being angry with those who are hardened, but is
even merciful and long-suffering towards the wicked themselves,
in long bearing with their wickedness.'

The first amplification therefore is from the greater z-N ot only

condly, it is amplified by its subject, which is designated by two
appellations: for they are first called “vessels of wrath ;'’ and are
next said to be fitted or framed (κατηρτισμένα) for destruction,'’
just as planks in a fabric are framed and mutually fitted to each
other: the former appellation indicates that hatred which was tes-
tified concerning Esau, (Mal. i. 3‚) and which is common to all
the ungodly, since they are all vessels of wrath, and such as God
hates, as we read concerning Esau in the passage referred to; the.
latter appellation indicates the predestination according to that
hatred, whereby, as vessels of wrath, they are destined for destruffi
· tion, to be affected by its own intermediate causes. The third par-
