equal measure with Moses, as appears from the reply of Jehovah
(vv. 6, 7, 8, of the same chapter). Thirdly, others glory concern-
ing a gift received, as if they had not received it3 as those who
are blamed on that account by the apostle in 1 Cor. iv. 7. Those‚
in fine, are said “to be wisc more than they ought,'' (ὑπεξ φρονεῖν)
who are either busy-bodies,* and think that they can do all things
by their own wisdom, even things to which they are by no means
called by the Lord3 or who, carried away by their opinion of their
own wisdom, search into, and think themselves able to discover
things, in the matter of saith and religion, which have not been re-
vealed at all by the Lord in his word. In short, therefore, all
those who are proud, either of a gift which they do not possess, or
of a gift received as if they had not received it, or who are busy-
bodies, and enquire into things not revealed, are said by the apostle
in this place—“ to be wise more than they ought'' (ὑπερ Quaen).
“As God hath imparted to every one the measure of faith.’' Thus
far the first part of this enjoining has been illustrated by the con-
trary ε now comes a second illustration of the same from a defini-
tion of ‘sober wisdom ς’ for “ to be wise unto sobriety'' (φξονεῖν ἐις
’ῒῆν σωφξθσῦνην) is——‘ to be wise according to the measure of saith
which Gocl has given to every one? “Faith,'' in this place, is
not as the Papists falsely and without authority affirm, a rule of
faith, handed down from the apostles, apart from the written and
only word, by which not only the profession and teaehing of every
one, but even the Scriptures themselves and the preaching of the
apostles are to be tried 3 since Scripture itself is the rule os saith,
nor is it to be tried by any other rule: but by “faith” is here
meant—‘ the knowledge of faith,' or ‘ the knowledge of God
through saith in J esus Christ, which Godv has given to every
one, out of the written word, through the operation of his
Spirit 3 and hence, what is here termed “ faith,'’ is called,
in 1 Cor. xii. 7—“ the manifestation of the Spirit,'’ (φανέρωσις τοῦ
πνεῦματος,) or ‘ the knowledge of faith manifested through the

Holy Spirit out of the written word.’ This “ faith,” or ‘ know-z
* nomn-edwom. '
