80 LOGICAL ANALYSIS oF THE

Adam, given in verses 12, 13, 14, this similitude being made up
of various comparisons of minority, in which are shewn t——the
greater efficacy of grace for the remission of sins than of the ori-
ginal fall for guilt, in verse 15 ; again of remission for justification,
than of that guilt for condemnation, in verse 163 and, lastly, of
justification for the reign of life, than of condemnation from the

various comparisons of minority the similitude is again deduced in
two parts, in verses 18 and 19.

established by the apostle from the 18th verse of chapter i. up to
this place. As, therefore, we have had a course of constructive
reasoning by which the doctrine of righteousness through saith
has been established, so we have next the destructive reasoning
by which the objections against the truth already established are
refuted. The objections of those arguing for the law against
faith are various. The first objection is concerning the use of the
law, and is suggested by the last conclusion :—

( If the righteousness of many is through the obedience of one,
the law, which was prior to the gospel, was ordained to no pur-

‘ But the latter is not true ε

‘ Therefore righteousness is not through the obedience of one,
nor the inheritance through faith on the promise, as has been
affirmed?

The apostle replies to the proposition of the objection in the'
words before us 3 and his reply consists of two parts. The first
