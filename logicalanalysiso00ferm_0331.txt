nance of God 3’ and by a twofold assertion founded upon that or-
dinance: the one assertion is propounded under the form of a
double negation—“ there is no power except from God ;'' the
other simply and absolutely—‘⁴ the powers which are, are by God ;''
and to both, the foundation and cause is subjoined‚ when the
apostle says, that they are—“ ordained’' by God.

2. “ Therefore whosoever setteth himself in opposition to the
power, resisteth the ordinance of God.” We have, in these words,
the proposition of the syllogism, including also the conclusion :—
‘ We must not resist the power, because we must not resist the
ordinance of God.’ “And they that resist bring condemnation
upon themselves.'' This is the establishment of the proposition,
from the effect of that resistance whereby any one resists the ordi-

reward of his resistance ι’

position to the power,' thus intimating, that there are cases in
which the powerful may be justly resisted. Although, for ex-
ample, the kingdom of Israel could not have resisted the power of
;Jeroboam,-when once he had been acknowledged as king, they
could have resisted him when he forced the calves upon them »ς
‘for such resistance would not have been resistance to the power,
but to the pou-erful one abusing his power: they could, nay, not
only could, with the approbation of God and their own consciences,
but even ouylzt to have so resisted ς’ and because they did not do
this, the people of Israel are every where rebuked by the prophete
as guilty of apostaoy in the sight· of God, inasmuch 'as they did
