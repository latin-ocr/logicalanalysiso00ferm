156 Loe1cAL ANALYSIS OF THE

brethren to himself, so that he wished to become anathema, if by
that means they might be gained over to Christ. The word
‘⁶ anathema'' properly signifies ί a thing laid up, or set apart and
separated 3' and is used in the WVord of God both in a good and in
a bad sense. Thus in Lev. xxvii. 28, ‘⁶ every devoted thing”
(ΒἾΠ) is said to be “holy to Jchovah :'' and the same thing is
frequently to be met with in other places, as in Numb. xviii. 14,
where the food of the priests, of which it was not lawful for the
unclean to eat, and which was consecrated to Jehovah, is called
‘⁴ a devoted thing” (ἀναθεμα) ; and in J osh. vi. 20 [17], where the
same epithet is applied to the city J ericho, which was wholly se-
parated to J ehovah from the people, either to be burnt with fire
or to serve Jehovah’s uses ς so in «Judges xiii. 5, Sampson is
spoken of as “ separated (ἾὋ) unto God.” But we have a most
manifest example of a different acceptation of the term in J osh.
vi. 21, according to the division of Tremellius,* where J oshua
says to the people,——“ keep yourselves from the anathema, lest ye
make yourselves anathema.'' The people of Israel were sacred to
God and separated from the Gentiles 3 and the city J ericho having
been already consecrated to God becomes anathema, and is sepa-
rated from the use of the people of Israel3 the people, therefore,
are commanded to beware of every thing in that city, lest if any

one should touch that which was “. anathema,” ‘ a thing separated ι

to J ehovah,’ he should render himself with the army of Israel
“ anathema”—‘ a thing separated,' not to God, but ‘ from Orod?
There is, therefore, an anathema ‘ to G0d‚’ and an anathema ‘from
Godz’ a Nazarite, or one who is consecrated to God, is-dwoew-
θέμενος, ⁴ separated to God 3’ and one who is accursed from God
is οαΠθᾶ-ἀναθεμια, ‘ separated from God? The apostle, there-
fore, to avoid this ambiguity of the term, says not merely—“ I

‹ could wish that I were anathema,’' but—‘⁶ 1 could wish that I

were anathema from Christ :”† this he illustrates from its end, by
adding—“ for my brethren,” and reasons thus :—
‘ I could wish that I were anathema from Christ for my breth-
