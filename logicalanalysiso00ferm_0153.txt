the cause of every sort of lust and sin, that is, of transgression in
the renewed man 3 whence it follows that ‘⁶ the mind ” or ⁴ spirit '
and ‘ new creature ' is in like manner the cause of begun obedience ε
—‘ Ι, being renewed, serve the law of God, so far as my mind is
concerned, or in so far as I am renewed ς and the mind, or new
creature, which is the spirit as opposed to the flesh, and the effect
of the spirit of regeneration, is the cause of that obedience of
mine: this obedience however is imperfect, for Ι, the same man
renewed, also transgress [the law of God], and serve the law of
sin; and the cause of this transgression is the fiesh or the still
remaining corruption of my nature,9 This epitome, as it were, of
the whole discussion regarding the law, the apostle deduces as a
corollary from the foregoing conclusion which was given in verse
24: ‘ My body, although Ι am removed, is, because of the law of
my members, a body of death ε

‘ Therefore, although with my mind Ι serve the law of God, yet
with my still remaining fiesh I serve the law of sin, that is sinful
sin, which-is contrary to the law of God.’

This one conclusion and corollary of the apostle meets, by infer-

in the first place, it is manifest, from this conclusion, that we ought
to serve the law ordained by God, and that all we who are renewed
and become new creatures, do serve it with the mind ;- whence the
reply to the first objection is at hand—‘ that the law is not useless,
nor given by God to no purpose, as was first objected, but that it
serves a twofold. purpose3 first, on account of him who is not re-
newed, to whom it displays sin, and, by displaying, increases it, as
was formerly said, chap. v., 203 for he should serve the law, which
he does not serve, but, on the contrary, the more he knows of it,
the more he sins and struggles against it known3 secondly, to the
renewed man, to whom, serving the law, it affords light for all
Ἰ ᾼ manner of obedience into holiness.' In the next place, it is mani-
> fest, from this conclusion, „that the law of God and the law of sin

- are contraries3 for “ with the mind,” says the apostle, ‘⁴ Ι serve the
law of God, but with the fiesh the law of sin ;’' whence there fol?
