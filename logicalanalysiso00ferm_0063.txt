EPISTLE OF PAUL TO THE ROMANS. - 21

consequent of each of the preceding enthymemes, which is also the
proposition of the second syllogism submitted to the judgment of
these wise men themselves :—“ (Thou) who judgest them that do
such things, and doest the same, thou shalt not escape the judg-
ment of God,’' or, ‘ in judging them thou condemnest thyself ς’
which, says Paul, ‘I submit to thine own judgment, that thou
mayest say what thou thinkest of it.’

4. “ Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness, and forbear-
ance, and long-suffe1·ing.” The apostle here makes a transition to
the second argument, by which he proves, that the wise men
among the Gentiles were likewise incxcusable before God, by
proleptically anticipating the objections which they would be
ready to start :—‘ God has hitherto borne with me, and Ι have
had experience of his goodness3 therefore I will make amends
to him by reproving others, and although I do the same things
myself I shall escape his judgment.9 To this the apostle re-
plies z——‘ Nayl thou who doest the same things, for which thou
Judgest another, thou art just so much the more liable to the judg-
' ment of God, that hitherto God has been good to thee. The
apostle reasons from the effect of his having so long experienced
the long-suffering of God, which effect is his despising God’s
long-suffering and goodness3 this is the first argument of the re-
ply :—‘ Thou despiseth the long-suffering of God 3 therefore God’s
long-suffering rendere thee so much the more inexcusable.'* “ Not
knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance ;''
this is the second argument of the reply, drawn from the end of

God’s goodness to the wicked, which is illustrated by their own -’

ignorance of it. The goodness of God towards the wicked should
- lead them to repentance3 or which is the same thing,—‘ He is
good to thee,’ says the apostle, ‘ that he may afford the‘e time and
move thee to repent3 therefore as thou dost not repent, thou art
inexcusable, and shalt not eScape his judgment? The apostle
’ therefore replies to the objection by denying the consequence,—
