rate us from the love of Orod? By this the apostle would teach
us, that that is not Christian faith which goes no farther than com-
mon knowledge, but that which individually applies the grace
known in common, and embraces it with the full persuasion
(πλῆξοφοξιᾳ) of the apostle. Thus far the proof 3 next- comes the
amplification of the reply, which consists of three parts3 for he
first illustrates created things, concerning which he denies that
they shall separate us from the love of God3 secondly, he illus-
trates the negation of the separation3 and, thirdly, the love from
which he denies that creatures shall separate us. As regards the
first, he amplifies created things by an induction of general and
things directly opposed to each other, such as are3 either ζ death,’
and those evils which threaten death,' or ‘life and those blessings
which are subservient to life ;' then, ‘things p1·escnt,’ or ‘things
to come ;' thirdly, ‘ things high,’ or ⁴ things deep ς’ 111 fine, he enu-
merates, as the leaders of all these hosts of foes and things ad-
verse to us—-⁴ the fallen angels with their principality and power7
over “the darkness of this world,'’ or, as he himself interprets
the expression, ‘ the children of disobedience and unbelief.' Against
all these created things and genera of created things, the apostle
glories that they shall not separate him from J esus Christ 3 'and
teaches that those who are genuine believers should each copy him
in this glorying. Tho second amplification is, that of the negation
of the separation, which is amplified by a comparison of minority :
‘ not only shall created things not separate us, but they shall not
even be able to separate 1115 from the love of God! The last illus-
tration is that of the love itself, from which the apostle denies that
he can be separated by the attempts or power of any created thing3
and he illustrates it by its subject, to wit—‘ J esus Christ,' in whom
God holds us dear, and in whom alone any one of men can love·

God.
