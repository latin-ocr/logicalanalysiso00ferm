92 Loo10AL ANALYSIS or THE

The proposition is first of all illustrated by distribution of its
parts, and each part in the distribution by its end :—“ to whom
ye yield yourselves servants unto obedience, his servants ye are,
either of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness;’' in
proof of which, he plies them with their own testimony—‘ Do you
not know this :2'

17. “But thanks be to God, that ye were the servants of sin ;
but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine into
which ye were delivered.”

18. “And being made free from sin, ye have been made over
unto righteousness.” The assumption of the syllogism is next
variously amplified: first, from their former condition when under
sin,—“ye were the servants of sin ;” then, from the adjunct of
the change effected in their condition by the Gospel-—“ye have
obeyed that form of doctrine into which ye were delivered,'' (these
two being put in contrast with each other) 3 thirdly, from the ad-
junct of the giving of thanks for the blessed change which they
had experienced3 and, lastly, it is illustrated from the contrary—-
“ being made free from sin, ye have been made over 'unto righte-
ousness.'’

19. “ I speak after the manner of men, because of the weakness
of your flesh.’' This is an epanorthosis‚ in which he corrects the
phraseology which he has just made use of, in saying that those
who are ‘⁶ under grace are made over unto righteousness,'' since,
on the contrary, they are set at liberty to serve G0d3 and he lays
the blame of this catachresis on their weakness, as the occasion of
it3 for, as they would not understand him expressing heavenly
things in the language of heaven, he is compelled, in teaching
them, to employ these similitudes of servitude and liberty, bor-
rowed from the intercourse of men.-“ For as ye have yielded
your members servants to uncleanness, and iniquity unto, inis
quity, even so now yield your members servants to righteousness
