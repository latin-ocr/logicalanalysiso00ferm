and when he calls them—“ members‚'‘ he indicates that the
Corinthian Church was ‘ a member, or· particular assembly,’ as
compared with other assemblies, or churches of Christ. “And
one by one members of each other.’' This is the second part of
the apodosis, by which two things are expressed τ first—‘ that
every one who is in Christ, apart, but especially he who teaches
or labours in the word, is furnished with his own separate gift in
the mystical body of Christ, for his own duty in the body, and the
performance of that duty ς’ secondly—‘ that as the gift, and duty,
and performance of duty of each have reference to the good of the
whole body, so ought they to have reference to the good of every
other member.’ The apostle therefore says, ‘ that every one is a
member, not merely of the body, but'also of every other member
in the body ς’ not as being properly a member of a member, but
because the action of each member is subservient to the use of
every other ; for although the eye in the external body is not a
member of the foot, but of the body, yet inasmuch as it serves the
foot by its action, it is in some sort a member of the foot also,
namely, as respects use. In like manner, although every one who
is in Christ is, properly speaking, a member of the body, yet he
may also be said to be a member of every other3 because, what÷
ever gift he has received from the common Lord, he has received
for the use of every member. ’”

in,' or have charge in the Churchssof God, and subjoins the second
part of ‘it‚ wherein he prohibits all those who in any way have charge
of Christ's flock, from the abuse of the gifts which they have re-
ceived for the edification and advantage of the Church of God3
as the apostle 'elsewhere testifies that “ the manifestation of the
Spirit’' ³* is given to every one who has it “ for profit,''† namely,
for the benefit and advantage of the Church. This part of the in-
junction is accordingly distinguished from the preceding, inasmuch
as the apostle has there prohibited arrogance in? the case 'of any
