4 But the former is true 3 we do not see the salvation which we
wait fort ”

4 Therefore we should wait for it with patient endurance.’

The proposition, which is hypothetical, is given in verse 25.

The assumption, viz—⁶ that hope, or the salvation hoped for,
is not seen,' is proved in this 24th verse, thus :—

‘ Hope,' or the ‘ hoped for salvation,’ for so I take the words to
be here used by metonymy, ‘ if it be seen, is not hope :

‘ Therefore hope, or the hoped for salvation is not seen.'

The apostle's argument is drawn from the contradiction of hope,
in the same way as he reasons farther on, chap. xi. 6, concerning
44 grace '³ and 44 work.'' The antecedent is proved from the
frustration of the end 2-—

‘ If any one hope for that which he sees, his hope will be frus-

sequent vv.—‘ our unfitness both to wait with patient endurance

for the promised inheritance in J esus Christ, and to invoke vthe ⁴

assistance of God, by which we may be enabled patiently to en—

dure and hope for it ε’ for by mentioning the latter, when he says ἱὁ
,-44 we know not what to pray for,’' the apostle presupposes the

former, since we would not ask aid, unless we were weak in our-
selves. The argument therefore runs thus:—

‘The Holy Spirit himself helpeth our weaknesses, both as· re-
gards hoping for the glory to be revealed, and suffering m the hope
