EPISTLE or PAUL To THE ROMANS. 369

His mother, again, is described as being also—‘ the mother of Paul,'
either from her maternal affection towards the apostle, on ac-
count of the work of the Lord in which he was engaged3 or even by
blood, as Andronicus, Junia and Herodion are called his “relatives :”
from all which examples we may perceive, that as the Apostle Paul
was the minister of God unto salvation, and the instrument of “ a
good work⁹⁷ to others, so he was also to many of his father's house.

14, 15. In the twelfth place, Asyncritas, Plzleqon, Hermas, Pat-
rohas and Hermes; Plziloloyus‘, Julia, Nereus with his sister, and
OlympaS, are saluted :and each induction of particular individuals
concludes with an epilogue, or abridged enumeration of “ brethren,''

or so that they may salute one another from him. This common .
salutation is first explained by the adjunct of the manner3 and is
next enforced by a similar example. As regards the manner, the
apostle bids them—“ salute one another with a holy kiss ;'' an en-
-treaty in which, by a metonymy of the adjunct for the subject,
he commends to the Romans a holy and sincere love, as the foun-
dation and source of all the salutations wherewith he has admonish-
ed them to salute one another z for a ‘⁶ kiss⁹³ is the token of ⁴ love 3’
and a “ holy kiss'’ of ‘ holy love in the Lord.’ When, therefore,
he prescribes* the kiss of such as love,’ instead of enjoining ‘ com-
mon love,’ he requires, not so much the sign itself, as the thing sig-
