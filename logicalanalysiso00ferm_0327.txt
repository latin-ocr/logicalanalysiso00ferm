EmsTLE oF PAUL To THE ROMANs. 285

“For if thou do so, thou shalt heap ooals of fire upon his head-'⁹
This is the second argument for the injunction, which is allegori-
oal‚ and taken from the same Scripture (Prov. xxv. 21, 22) whence
the injunction itself was horrowed. By this allegory, the Holy
Spirit indicates, that if the Christian does good to him who desires
to do him evil, he will render his enemy, or him who desires to do
him evil, if he repent not, inexcusable (ἂναπολογητον) by so do-
ing3 and will thus heap up for him wrath against the day of
wrath, and judgment against the day of the just judgment of God3
for as eoals of fire, placed on the head, torment the man on whose
head they are placed, so the good deed performed by a godly man
towards his enemy, will torment him, both in this life with the con-
seiousness of his injury and inexcusableness,* and for ever, if he
repent not, by the heaping up of the wrath and judgment of God.
Of this we have an example, in the justification of David by Saul,
which he extorted from his enemy, again and again, by doing him
good. (1 Samuel xxiv. 183 xxvi. 21.)

21. “Be not overeome by what is evil, but overcome malice by
goodness.''
- This is the injunction concerning the duty which jointly de-
volves, both upon the Christian who has suffered injury, and upon
him who is aimed at by an enemy that he may be injured ;—‘ it
devolves on both, jointly‚ not to be overoome by the evil deed of.
him who does evil to the one, or has wished to do evil to the other3
but it devolves on the Christian to overcome the maliee of both by
his own goodness. ‘ To be overeome by evil ’ is-—‘ to be indueed
by the evil deed of a wicked man to do evil to him in return,’ but
‘ to overeome malice by goodness’ is—‘ to be so superior to our
enemies, whether they have done us evil, or have wished to do us
evil in time to come, that they may be compelled, by the evidence

of our goodness and performance of duty, frankly to justify us, as
Saul did David?
