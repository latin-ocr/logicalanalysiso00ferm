310 LOGICAL ANALYsm OF THE

those very things which formerly were indifferent, at length be-
come heresies, which the strong in saith must oppose. So, after
Paul had circumcised Timothy for the sake of the weaker, he op-
posed circumcision in the case of Titus3 the defenders of which,
as has been said, he calls ‘ emissaries of Satan,' and the professors
of which he informs, that if they persist in their profession of cir-
cumcision, “ Chrisff’ offered in the gospel “will profit them no·—
thing’' (Gal. v. 2). Hence an answer may be returned to those
who, from verses 2 and 5 of this chapter, accuse of an infringement
of the duty to be performed towards weak brethren, those who too
sharply rebuke and censure the keeping of other feast-days in the
Christian Church, besides the sabbath, the substitution of a hierarchy
for ecclesiastical synods, and other things of the same kind, which
they themselves haughtily affirm to be indifferent3 ‘ in which,’ say
they, ⁴ if there be any fault, it is only a sin of weakness, and such
that the peace of the Church is not to be disturbed on account of
it by too bitterly censuring the weak, but that the individuals
themselves who thus err are to be received and embraced as breth-
ren in Christ? The answer to be returned to these persons is to
this effect z—that all that they say is true, so long as the things
which they call indifferent, are indifferent, and the brethren whom
they call weak, are weak3 but if, after these weak brethren have
been received, and affectionately taught their weakness from the
word of God, they are nevertheless unwilling to forsake the path
of weakness—then neither are they themselves any longer weak, ,
but obstinate and heretica13 nor are those things which they obsti-

’ nately defend, and which at first indeed, so ,long as they themselves .

were weak, were indifferent, any longer to be regarded as indiffe-
rent, but as heresies to be most strenuously opposed by the stronger
or more sincere in saith, and the defenders of them to be rejected,
as false brethren: and in so doing, the stronger neither sin, nor
disturb the peace of the Church censuring the weak3 but the
whole fault in this case lies with the individuals themselves who
wish to be considered weak, inasmuch as they obstinately refusa
to surrender themselves, either to God, or to the word of God,v0t
