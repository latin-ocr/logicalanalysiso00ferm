EPISTLE or PAUL To THE Romns. 197

the name of God. This third argument is taken, partly from the
adjunct of the sending or inward calling of the apostles, partly
from the conduct of the Israelites in rejecting the apostles with their
preaching. The apostle therefore reasons thus :——

‘ Although those who reject the apostles and men sent by God
to preach the gospel, invoke God, and have a zeal, yet is that zeal
not according to knowledge3

‘But we have been sent by God, and the Israelites reject us
sent by God :

⁴ Therefore, although the Israelites have a zeal of God, yet that
zeal of theirs is not according to knowledge!

The proposition of this syllogism, which is omitted, the apostle
proves from the adjunct of the necessity of the sending or inward
calling of those who preach, which he demonstrates in verse 14,
and the beginning of verse 15, by a resolution of effeets into their
necessary causes, and that of five stages. The first effect is—
‘ invocation,' which, from the foregoing testimony, the apostle has
proved to be of necessity previous to salvation3 hence, therefore,

he thus reasons by a sorites, or prosyllogism of successive stages :—

‘There is no invocation without faith3 there is no saith without
- hearing ; there is no hearing without a preacher 3 there is no
preaeher without sending:

‘ Therefore, from first to last, there is no invocation unto salva-
tion, unless those who are to preaeh the word of God have been
sent, and, consequently, the invocation of all who reject the apostles
and those whom God sends to preach the word of saith, is no in-
vocation, and although they have a zeal, they have not that zeal
which is according to knowledge?

From this chain of effects and causes, the apostle would teach
us three things 2--1st, That the invocation and zeal of unbelievers,
although they present the appearance of remarkable devotion, are
yet all nothing more than an empty shew, but no genuine invocas-
tion or zeal, because invocation ,unto salvation belongs only to
those who believe3 2dly, That there is ordinarily no saith apart
from the word, (for it is the ordinary administration of God which
