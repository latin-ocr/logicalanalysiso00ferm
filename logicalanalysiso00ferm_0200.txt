158 LOGIOAL ANALYSIS ol? THE

from the adjunct of the various prerogatives of the Israelitish
people, by which they were hitherto distinguished above all the
Gentiles, and on account of which especially the apostle has ex-
pressed such a wish 3 because his brethren by their abuse os them,
and especially by their rejection of Christ, not only deprived
themselves of the advantages of so great prerogatives, but were
besides a greater stumbling-block to others in proportion to the
greatness of the privileges which they formerly enjoyed 3 for when
apostates have been previously enriched with great gifts and pre-
rogatives they occasion great offence, and are a source of great
sorrow to the godly. This the apostle here teaches, both on ac-
count of the abuse of the gifts, and because the offence given to
the ungodly was increased by the eoecellenee of the gifts'. Of these
prerogatives heretofore peculial· to the Israelites, six are here enu-
merated by the apostle. The first is ‘⁶ adoption ;'' by which I
understand—⁴ the election of this people before all the nations to
be the people of God,’ (Dent. x. 15‚) and in reference to which,
God calls the people of Israel his ‘4 first-born,'’ (Exod. iv. 22, 23.)
The second prerogative is here styled “the glory;’' under which
title I understand—‘ the ark of the covenant,' which in 1 Sam. iv.
22, is called ‘⁴ the glory,'' because it was the visible token of the
presence of God among that people, whereby they were a glorious
people, and excelled every other people on the earth. The third
prerogative is—‘ the giving of a threefold law, the moral, the judi-
cial, and the ceremonial.' The first of these, or ‘ the moral laW,' the
apostle here denominantes—‘⁶ the covenants,'' because it contains the
condition of the covenant of works, (Gal. iii. 12 3) and he says, “cove-
nants” in the plural, not ί covenant,' because the violation of any
one precept is a violation of the whole condition, (J ames ii. 10‚)
just as if the several precepts of the moral law were so many cove- ‘
nants or conditions of the covenant of works, all of which, if any
one did not fully perform, he could look for nothing from that cove-
nant but the ban and curse of the law—“ cursed is every one who
hath not continued in all things which are written in the book of
the law' to do them,’' (Gal. iii. 10.) ⁴ The judicial law’ is here
