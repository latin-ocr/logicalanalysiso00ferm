EPISTLE oF PAUL rro Tm: ROMANS. 199

17. “ Therefore saith is from hearing, and hearing through the
word of God.’' The conclusion of the third argument—‘ There-
fore the invocation of the Israelites is no invocation, and although
they have a zeal, yet it is not according to knowledge,'--being,
with divine prudence, suppressed to avoid offending the Israelites,
as has often been done before in this discussion, the apostle sub-
stitutes for it this other, in which he passes from them to believers
themselves, and those who call upon the name of God in truth,
with the view of ‘provoking the disobedient Jews to emulation,'
as he openly avows further on, chap. xi. 14. From the same
sorites, or series of abridged syllogisms, as in verse 14, he con-
· eludes—⁶ that faith, which is the foundation of invocation, is both
produced and increased by the hearing of the gospel preached by

, himself and the other apostles ς’ and that in this way :—

⁶ There is ordinarily no faith without hearing3 there is no hear-
ing without a preacher3 there is no preacher unless he has been
sent:

‘ Therefore, saith is from hearing, and hearing through the word
announced by the apostles, or those heralds whom God sends?

The argument is from what equally follows, contrariwise, in the
case of contradictories t ³¹⁶

⁴ Without the hearing of the word preached, or where there is
no hearing of the word preached, there is no saith:

⁶ Therefore, contrariwise, or conversely, faith is from hearing, or
through the word? And this appears to be said by a sort of apo-
strophe,† whereby he avoids a direct reference to his opponents,
the Israelites, arguing against the Church of God which has em-

braced the truth.

18. “But I say, have they not heard ?'' Next come three pro-
lepses, in which the apostle anticipates objections arising out of the
last argument z Of these, two are contained in the remainder of this
chapter3 the third is given in the commencement of the following.

* ι’. e.‚ in modern language—-‘ by contraposition,’ or ‘ conversion by negatiou.’
