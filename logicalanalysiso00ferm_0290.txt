248 LOGICAL ANALYSIS OF THE

ment contained in these words is drawn from the efficient cause,'
in this way :—

‘ Since God is merciful to you in the communication of
the gospel, and of his grace in his Son,⁷ as has before been
proved, and has thus shewn that he entertains towards you
the affection of a father, and that of the tenderest kind (Isaiah
xlix. 14, 15):

‘ Do you therefore, as a thanksgiving for so great a kindness—

so the acceptableness, in J esus Christ, of our imperfect obedience,
is compared to the acceptableness of these sacrifices: for as many

things which are said in the law about the sacrifices to be offered .

to God were shadows of the Son of God, who was offered on the - κ .
