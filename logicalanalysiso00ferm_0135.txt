EPISTLE OF PAUL TO THE ROMANS. 93

unto holiness.’' In these words we have the conclusion of the syl-
logism‚ viz„ ‘that those who are under grace should not sin7’ illus-
trated by a comparison of similarity with their previous conduct,
both the protasis and apodosis of which are illustrat-ed by their
end.

20. ‘⁴ For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from
righteousness.’' This is the second argument for the reply, from
what equally follows on the contrary supposition—‘ When you
were the servants of sin, you were free from righteousness ε

‘ Therefore, now that through grace you are become the servants
of righteousness, be free, and abstain from sin.'

21. “What fruit had ye then in those things of which ye are
now ashamed‘? for the end of those things is death-'⁹ The third
argument by which the apostle proves that the children of grace
must not sin, is taken from the effects or fruits of sin, which are
‘ disgrace' or ‘ shame‚' and ‘ death ς’ and he reasons thus——

‘ Those things from which there is no fruit in the doing of them,
and which are afterwards followed by disgrace and death, should
not be done:

‘ But, oh you who are under grace l whilst you sinned you had
no fruit from your sins‚’—here the apostle appeals to their own
consciousness—“ What fruit had ye then ?''—‘ and now they are
followed by disgrace or shame'—“ of which ye are now ashamed'’
—‘and death awaits those who persist in them’—-“ the end of
these things? says the apostle‚ ‘⁴ is death :'' ’ ’

· ‘ Therefore, those who are under grace should not sin!

22. “ But now, being made free from sin, and made over unto
God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end eternal life.'’
He now illustrates the foregoing assumption by a contrast :—
‘ Whilst you simod, you had no fruit, but now, in serving God
you have fruit3 your sins were followed by shame3 but now the
service of God is followed by holiness3 the end of sin is death,
