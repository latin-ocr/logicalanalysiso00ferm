EPISTLE OF PAUL TO THE ROMANs. 161

then is saith on him, and consequently himself apprehended by ,

faith, the true way of righteousness and salvation, in spite of his
rejection by the Jews ;

‘But the former is true:

‘ Therefore, so is also the latter?

The proposition is self-evident, and such as cannot be contra-

‘ The word of God has not failed:

‘ Therefore those who are true Israeliten, or those to whom the
