Eris‘rLE OF PAUL To THE RoMANs. 331

‘⁴ Because he eateth not from faith.” The antecedent is here
proved :—‘ because he does not eat, as you eat, with the persuasion
that he is doing right! “And whatsoever is not from saith is
sin.'' This is the reason of the consequence3 which, along with

the preceding clauses of the verse, constitute a complete syllogism
thus :—

‘Whatever is not from faith is sin, and he who does it is con-
demned for doing it 3

‘ But he that eats, doubting, does not eat from saith 3

‘ Therefore, if any one eats, doubting, he sins, and is con-
demned?

In both these arguments you are to understand this ‘ condemna-
tion,’ not of—‘ the casting away of the reprobate by God‚’ but of—
‘ the condemnation of the conscience from the commission of sin ε’
so that the import of that first general maxim is—‘ that he is
happy who does not contract a bad conscience to himself, in that
which he knows to be rightly done ς’ and in the second argument,
the import of the conclusion is—‘ that he who eats, doubting, con-
tracts a bad conscience to himself, because he sins in eating.’

CHAPTER XV.

v We have next, in the first four verses of this chapter, the third
and last injunction given to the strong, concerning their duty
towards the weak3 for which the apostle brings forward two
arguments: the first from the adjunct of debt, in the lst verse3
and the second from the example of Christ, in the 3d verse;
betwixt these comes in the conclusion, in verse 23 and in the 4th
verse, he meets an objection arising out of the proof of the second

argument.

1. “ Moreover, we 'that are strong ought,’' 8⁶0. This is the first
argument, which is to the following effect :—
