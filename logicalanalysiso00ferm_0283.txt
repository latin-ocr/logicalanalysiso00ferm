EPISTLE or ium, To 'run nmmxs, 241

displaying his own mercy in J esus Christ3 which mercy, whoso- ·
ever shall despise‚ shall perish eternally to the glory of his justice
in judgment, as those who have been fore-ordained to that des-
pisal.' This same mercy and justice the apostle has set before us
for our contemplation, when, in the 22d verse preceding, he ad-
monishes every one, saying,--“ Behold, therefore, the goodness and.
severity of God ;'’ just as also, in the following verse, he admires
the wisdom, knowledge, and justice of God, as shining forth in his

tical* conclusion of the discussion which had been prosecuted from
the commencement of chapter ix, up to this place, concerning the
revolt of the Israelites, the calling of the Gentiles, and the rec-al
of Israel when once the fulness of the Gentiles has been brought
in. The epiphonema consists of two parts. The first part, which
is given in this 33d verse, contains an assertion of the wisdom of
God, the knowledge of God, and the justice of God in all his ad- .
ministration3 the assertion being—‘ that God himself is wisdom
itself, knowledge itself, and justice itself! This assertion, more-
over, is embellished by a twofold exclamation, wherein the apostle
admires the wisdom, knowledge, and justice that are in God. “ Ο
the profound riches, both of the wisdom and of the knowledge of
God !'' This is the first exclamation, in which he both magnifies and.
admires, as well the wisdom as the knowledge of God. He mag-
nifies them, moreover, in two ways. First, absolutely, when he
puts—“ the riches of the wisdom,” and ‘⁴ the riches of the know-
vlege” for—‘ the wisdom,' and ‘ the knowledge’ “ of G0d;” by
which magnifying he would intimate—‘ that God himself is rich
,in wisdom, also that the knowledge of God is the riches of know-
ledge, and, consequently, that God is ric-h in knowledge 3' for so
'the apostle is elsewhere wont to express the essential knowledge

⁴ of God3 as in Col. ii.f3‚ where he says, that in Christ “ are hid
all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge,” just as “ in him
