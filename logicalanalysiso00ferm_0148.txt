does contrary to the law : ‘ If that which Ι (10, contrary to the law,
I am unwilling to do, I consent to the law that it is good3

‘ But the former is true?

The proposition is given in verse 16. The assumption is proved
in verse 15, from its disparates :—⁴ What I practise contrary to the
law, Ι allow not3 what Ι practise contrary to the law, Ι would not,'
(the former being the approbation of the judgment3 the latter of
the will; and each being illustrated by a contrast,) ί but what Ι
do contrary to the law, Ι hate :

‘ Therefore, that which Ι (10 contrary to the law, I am unwilling

me practises:

‘ Therefore‚ Ι am carnal, and subject to sin3’ or, which is the
same thing, “ Ι find (that I am under) this law, that when I would
do good evil is present with me.’'

The antecedent is contained in the 17th verse3 the consequent
in verse 21. ’

no good.'' This is a prolepsis by which, in passing, he anticipates
the objection, ⁴ Does sin then dwell in you, although renewed ?'
The apostle replies by a comparison of majority :—‘ Not only does
sin dwell in me, but, what is more, there dwells no good in me?
At the same time, however, he inserts, within a parenthesis, this
epanorthosis, ‘ When I say that sin dwells in me, I do not mean,

in me, so far as I am renewed, but so far as I am still flesh3‘ so -

that, “in me,” is equivalent to, ‘ in my flesh! He proves what
Δ he has said by his own expericnce—‘I know this? The apostle
