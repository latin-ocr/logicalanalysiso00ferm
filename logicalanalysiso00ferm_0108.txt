CHAPTER V.

1. “ Therefore being justified from faith, we have peace towards
God.'’ This chapter may be divided into three sections3 in the
first of which, extending as far as verse 12, we have a com-
mendation ofjustification from faith 3 the second, from verse 12
onwards to the 20th contains the conclusion of the foregoing dis—

works, but all by a common saith on one who justifies many, namely,
J esus Christ, the second Adam3 ⁴the third section consiste of the
last two verses of the chapter, and in it we have the commence-
ment of the refutation.

tion from faith is taken from its effects, and may be said to con-
stitute a fourth argument in support of that doctrine, in this way.

‘ Whatever is followed by peace with God, restoration into his*
grace, and glorying in the hope of the glory of God, that is the
true justification of man before God :—

‘ But this peace, restoration and glorying follow, not the justi-
fication of the law but the justification of saith :—

‘ Therefore it is justification from faith by which we are justified
before God?

The proposition, as being sufficiently obvious, is omitted. The
assumption is given in ver. 1 and 2, and contains the said com-

hysterosis, put first3 and that which is first in order occupics the
second place : since our restoration into grace or our reconciliation
with God is prior to our peace towards God. For “ peace to-
wards God‚” as I here understand it, is the whole effect -of our
