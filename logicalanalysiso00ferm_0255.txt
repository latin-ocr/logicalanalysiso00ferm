for the unclean spirit himself, where he has once been expelled by
the power of a stronger than he, namely, of the Holy Spirit, never
returns thither again. An “ unclean spirit,'’ therefore, is ‘un-
cleanness proceeding from an unclean spirit,’ which being broken
off for a time by the power of the ministry, the spirit himself, from
whom it proceeds, appears to have been expelled from hypocrites.
And from Luke xiii. 11, where ⁴ the infirmity of being bowed
down’ is called-“ a spirit of infirmity,’' which is explained in verse
16, where we are told that “ Satan had bound’' the wretched wo-
man therewith. When the apostle, therefore, quoting from the
prophet, says—‘⁴ God hath given them a spirit of deep sleep,” the
meaning is—‘ that God, by means of evil spirits, as the avengers
of the sins of this people, and the ministers of his own wrath, has

says that their table would become not only a snare, but also a
“ retribution,'’ whereby he would intimate that this judgment, viz.,
‘ that the law should become a snare to them,' is the just recom-
pense (o'wrtfma'Otoev) of their sin3 for, as they perverted the sacri-
fices and service of the law to another end than that for which the
law was given by God, so it is a retribution and just compensation
from God, that the sacrifices and service of the law should serve
another end to them thanffthat for which God gave them the law,
The law was given as a “ child leader to Christ,'' (Gal. iii. 24);
when, therefore, through zeal for the law, they reject Christ, the
