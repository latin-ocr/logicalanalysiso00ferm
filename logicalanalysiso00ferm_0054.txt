12 LOGICAL ANALYSIS OF THE

his discussion into two parts, the first of which is on righteousness,
continued from this verse as far as chap. viii.; the second, on life,
from chap. viii. to chap. xii. Each of these has its own construe-
tive, and destructive reccsoninq or refutation, by the one of which the
apostle first establishes the truth, and then by the other, removes
objections against it.

He commences the constructive reasoning of the first part here,
and pursues it to the 20th verse of chap. v.; the rest of that chapter
and the two following are devoted to the refutation. As regards
the constructive reasoningy, he first proves that righteousness is by
faith, as far as chap. v.; he then illustrates it by its effects, from
the beginning of that chap. to the 12th ver.; verses 12 to 20 be-
ing occupied by the conclusion, which is variously amplified.

The proof consists of three arguments. The first is taken fr0m
the disparates of that of which he is speaking, viz., the law of Mo-
ses, which was the boast of the Jews, and the law of nature, in
which the philosophers and wise men among the Gentiles gloried.
The apostle joins these together, as equally opposed to the gospel,

· and reasons thus :—

‘ Either man is justified before God from the works of the law,
or from faith3

‘ But he is not justified from the works of the law :

‘ Therefore he is jus‘tified from saith?

This argument he prosecutes from this place to the commence-
ment of chap. iv· ; and first of all proves the assumption,* for he
takes the profession† for granted3 the sole argument in proof of
the assumption being drawn from the adjunct of the common guilt
with which all are chargeable :

⁴ All men (both Jews and Gentiles) are chargeable with “ all
ungodliness and unrighteousness'' (i. e. with the transgression of
both tables of the law) ;

‘ Therefore no man, whether he be J ew or Gentile, shall be
justified from the works of the law (either the law of Moses or the
law of nature).’
