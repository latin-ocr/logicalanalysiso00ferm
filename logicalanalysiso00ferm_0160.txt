11⁶8 LOGICAL ANALYSIS or THE

form was like to flesh subject to sin 3’ so that Christ-man, that is,
Christ in his flesh, was a man in all respects like to ourselves‚ sin
excepted. The apostle does not deny that it was real flesh in
which the Son of God was sent⁷ but says that. it was like to sinful
flesh3 the flesh of Christ, therefore, was real flesh‚ but in that
flesh there was no sin. The second part of the subject of the gos-
pel is‚—‘ the condemnation of sin in the flesh.' By ‘⁴ the flesh ’'
here Ῑ unde1·stand——‘ the flesh of Christ,' which, although it was
not subject to sin, yet became subject to condemnation on account
of sin, and in the room of sinful flesh: for as it was the violation
of the law in the flesh by which God was offended3 so it behoved
satisfaction to be made in the flesh. Sinful fiesh being unable to
render this satisfaction, ‘ G0d,’ says the apostle‚ ‘sent his Son in
real flesh, like to that which was sinful‚ that sin might be con-
demned in that which was not sinfuL and satisfaction made for
the sin of sinful flesh; ’ where, by ‘ conclemnation‚’ I understand
—-‘ the punishment for sin which Christ underwent‚ and the
abolishing of sin by himself? This condemnation of sin, or the
punishment by which it is abolished, is explained by its final causet*
--‘ sin was condemned,’ that is, ‘ punishment was inflicted in the
flesh of Christ, and that because we had sinned against God ; ' so
that the final cause * of the condemnation of sin in the flesh of the
Son of God was our sin. Both this condemnation and the incar-
nation of the Son of God are explained by their common efficient
cause :-—‘ for God,’ says the apostle‚ ‘ both sent his son in the
flesh, and condemned sin in the flesh of his Son? Thus far the
subject of the gospel: its end is set forth in these words at the
commencement of verse 4,-“ that the rights of the law may be
fulfilled in us (by the condemnation of sin in the flesh of the Son
of God.)” By “the rights of the law ’' I understand here—‘ that
righteousness which the law requires ; ’ which being rendered, its
rights are rendered to the law, and from which he who shall err
even in the least degree violates the law, and detracts ftom its
rights. Moreover these rights of the law “ are fulfilled in us '⁹ by
