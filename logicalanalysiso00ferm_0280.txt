238 LOGICAL foALYffls oF THE

first thing is, that the mind of the apostle is this, ‘that the Ῐε-
raelitish nation, from the time that they were once elected in their
fathers, beloved and effectually called to Goel, have never since
been, nor ever shall be rejected by God, but always continue the
people of God among the rest of the elect, as they were in the days
of Elijah and. Paul, and shall be in the days of their future recal ε’
and this is what the apostle expressly asserts in verse 2 of this
chap. “ God hath not cast away his people whom he foreknew.''
The second thing which falls to be observed by us here, is that·
although the hardened and apostates in the Israelitish nation often
formed the great majority of that people, as they continue from the
days of Paul to the present day 3 yet these, according to the mind
of the apostle, are never to be reckoned the Israelitish nation‚ but,
as he has spoken above, dried branches from the trunk of Israel,
which have been broken off through their own unbelief.

30. The next two verses contain the fifth argument, whereby
the apostle proves that the Jews are to be recalled to the God of
their salvation. The argument is taken from the end of Israel’s
apostacy or revolt—⁶ the Israelites have not obeyed G0d‚ but have'
revolted, for this end, that they themselves might afterwards ob—
tain mercy 3’ from which end the apostle thus reasons : ’ V

‘ Whosoever are disobedient for this end, that they may afterz
wards obtain mercy, shall obtain it’—-this, which is the proposition,
is omitted, as being obvious and sels-evident3 the assumption is
illustrated by a comparisonf'- ¹ ’

' ‘ As the Gentiles, who were formerly unyielding and disobediss·
ent to God, have since obtained meroy3 so the Israelites‚ who are'
now unyielding and disobedient to the gospel, shall again obtain
mercy to the obedience of the gospel, and. participation of the sah
vation which' ιε in J esus Christ. ·'
’ ‘ Therefore the Israelites, who have become disobedient, shall
obtain mercy, and are to be recalled to the God of their salvatione* . ,
