EPISTLE or PAUL To THE ROMANS. 145

soluble connection with the ‘ righteousness' and ‘ glory' that fol-
low: so that by reason of that indissoluble connection, we have
here a truly golden chain, from any one of the benefits included in
which we may infer the rest, one by one3 and so from all or any
one of them, we may conclude that all things turn out for good to
the man who is a partaker thereos, as we have just seen the apos-
tle doing, when he asserts that—⁴< all things work together for
good to those who are the caHed according to his purpose.''

31. “ What shall we say, therefore, to these things? If God be
for us, who is against us ‘?’' We come now to the third section of
the chapter, and the conclusion of the leading syllogism, which is
first stated generally in vv. 31, 32, and then explained by its parts
in the remaining verses to the end of the chapter. The general
conclusion, deduced from what has gone before is this—‘ there is
no one against us,' ἀεὶ. ⁶ against any of us who are Christ's 3' the
deduction being marked by the illative particle “ therefore.” This
conclusion is embellished in these two verses by an anacoenosis
embracing two interrogations: the first—“ What shall we say to
these things ‘?” the second-“ Who is against us ⁴?’' In each of these
the hypophora or subjoined reply is--‘ We must say that there is
no one against us,' or ‘ we have no cause to fear any one that is
against us 3’ which reply, although here omitted, or rather implied
in the second interrogation, is frequently expressed in the Psalms,
as in Ps. cxviii. 6, 7, and many others. The import of this hypo-
phora or reply is not—that the pious have no adversaries; since,
on the contrary, the apostle testifies in Eph. vi. 12, and following
verses, that ‘⁶ we wrestle not (only) against flesh and blood, but
against spiritual wickednesses,'’ compared with which fiesh and
blood might be accounted nothing: but the meaning of the con-
clusion is—-that although the pious have many· foes,—the flesh, the
world and the devil—yet none of their foes shall prevail over them
to hurt them3 so that the pious and those that are heirs of God in
J esus Christ may despise all their foes, and all those that are
against them, as the ⁴Psalmist explains it in Ps. cxviii. 6. Two
