wherein the apostle replies to a third objection of the Gentiles in
reference to their glorying against the Israelites, and their recal to
the God of their salvation. ⁴⁴ The branches were broken off,” &e.
This objection of the Gentiles is taken from the end of the rejec-

of the reply is the granting of the antecedent, namely——‘ that the
Jews were rejected, and have become branches broken off for this
end, that the Gentiles might be engrafted in their room.’

and of the engrafting of the Gentiles. On the one hand, he as—
